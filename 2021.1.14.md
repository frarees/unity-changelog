### 2021.1.14f1 Release Notes

#### Features

-   Mobile: Adaptive view distance scaler - A new scaler to change the Camera.main view distance automatically.

-   Mobile: Boost mode - Boost CPU and GPU for short periods of time.

-   Mobile: Cluster info - Request cluster info to have details which and how many cores are available on the device.

-   Mobile: Feature API - Check which Adaptive Performance feature is available on the current platform.

-   Mobile: Scaler profiles - Easily define and change Adaptive Performance Scalers with predefined profiles.

#### API Changes

-   Graphics: Added: Added SpeedTree8MaterialUpgrader, which provides utilities for upgrading and importing SpeedTree 8 assets to scriptable render pipelines.

-   HDRP: Added: Added SpeedTree8MaterialUpgrader, which provides utilities for upgrading and importing SpeedTree 8 assets to scriptable render pipelines.

-   Shadergraph: Added: Added an HLSL file implementing a version of the Unity core LODDitheringTransition function which can be used in a Shader Graph

-   Shadergraph: Added: Added subshadergraphs for SpeedTree 8 shadergraph support: SpeedTree8Wind, SpeedTree8ColorAlpha, SpeedTree8Billboard.
