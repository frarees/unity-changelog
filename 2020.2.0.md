-   Particles: Improved performance by removing unnecessary calls to`      ParticleSystemRenderer::UpdateCachedMesh     `. This especially improves performance of enabling or disabling ParticleSystemRenderers that use meshes consisting of Triangle Strip geometry.([1271169](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particles-updatecachedmesh-needlessly-called-when-disabling-thne-enabling-a-particlesystemrenderer))

-   Prefabs: Improved the performance of Prefabs in the Editor.\

-   Prefabs: Improved the performance of the prefab editor.

-   Prefabs: Introduced the**Allow Auto Save**Project Setting for Prefab Mode. It is enabled by default, which matches the same behavior in previous versions of Unity. However, if you disable this setting, Unity does not auto save while in Prefab Mode, and the toggle is not displayed. This is different to the main Auto Save toggle, which is a per-user setting that carries across projects. This new setting applies to all users of the project.(1141476)

-   Prefabs: Prefabs with a lot of properties load faster than before.

-   Profiler: Optimized Profiler Window chart updates.

-   Profiler: Updated the Hierarchy and Timeline view to no longer display frame data while profiling unless the \"Live\" toggle is enabled. This reduces the Editor overhead while profiling the Editor or Play mode.

-   Scripting: Improved the query time of Camera.main.

-   Scripting: Improved UnsafeUtility.Malloc so that it throws an exception when it is given a positive alignment value that is not also a power of two. Previously this was only flagged as an assert in debug builds.

-   Scripting: Improved`      UnityWebRequest.certificateHandler     `so it is now invoked for root certificates on Windows.

-   Scripting: Updated AtomicSafetyHandle to throw ObjectDisposedExceptions instead of InvalidOperationException when code attempts to access a container after it has been disposed. This mimics the behavior of built-in container types.

-   Terrain: Added warnings which occur if you paint too many detail objects on terrain. Unity will now draw red boxes highlighting these areas in the scene view and display an error message explaining the issue.([1248488](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hitting-the-upper-bound-of-detail-meshes-causes-previously-placed-detail-meshes-to-dissappear))

-   Terrain: Made Terrain per-frame CPU updates less resource-intensive.

-   Windows: Improved`      Time.deltaTime     `consistency for D3D11 graphics API.

-   Windows: Improved`      Time.deltaTime     `consistency for D3D12 graphics API.

-   Editor: As part of gizmo optimizations, we\'ve made many gizmos (e.g. collider gizmos) fade out and turn off when they are small on screen. Cameras typically used for planar reflections (ones with oblique clip projection matrix) now also do not render gizmos.

-   iOS: Removed support for Launch Images, to adhere to new Apple guidelines.
