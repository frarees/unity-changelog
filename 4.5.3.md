## Release notes

### Features

-   Core: Added Resources.LoadAsync() to asynchronously load assets from the Resources folders (Pro only).
-   Editor: Added iOS support for Unity Remote 4 on Windows.
-   Graphics: Added support for the -nographics command line argument in OS X.
-   Windows Phone: Unity now supports building native Windows Phone 8.1 applications.
-   Windows Store / Phone: Unity now supports building "Universal" Windows Store/Phone applications.
-   Windows Player: Added ability to select target monitor in the resolution dialog, including devices like Oculus Rift.

-   Physics 2D: Added ability to select whether deleting a 2D collider or rigid body during a collision callback stops remaining callbacks or not.
-   Physics 2D: Fixed regression where 2D colliders didn\'t update when animated.
-   Physics 2D: Fixed crash when Rigidbody2D component is destroyed during contact callback.
-   Physics 2D: Ensure that the lower/upper translation limits on JointTranslationLimit2D are correct with respect to each other (used on SliderJoint2D).
-   Physics 2D: Stop interpolation/extrapolation from being halted during next physics update when a new Rigidbody2D is added.
-   Shaders: Fixed more cases of errors in shaders not being reported on correct line numbers (for GLSL platforms).
-   Shaders: Fixed wrong HLSL-to-GLSL translation of clip() with a vector argument.
-   Shuriken: Fix for re-enabled particle system which was disabled before it has finished.
-   Substance: Normal maps are correctly displayed now in the Editor when targeting GL platforms.
-   Substance: Thumbnails for normal maps are now generated correctly instead of being displayed in grayscale.
-   Substance: Fixed crash when baking a ProceduralTexture without mipmaps to a compressed format.
-   Substance: Fixed ProceduralMaterials looking black after disabling the ProceduralMaterialInspector.
-   Version Control: Adding files in perforce would escape special characters such as \'@\' into \'%40\'. This issue has been fixed.
