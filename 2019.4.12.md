#### API Changes

-   Animation: Added: A new parameter was added to the MatchTarget function for auto matching completion in case of interruption

-   Build Pipeline: Added: Added internal API to capture performance data from the ContentBuildInterface methods.

-   iOS: Added: Added a public accessor for the legacy Game Center player ID, to give games an easier pathway to migrate to the new ID types in iOS 12.4

#### Changes

-   Android: Bump Android Logcat verified version to 1.2.0

-   Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.2.17

#### Improvements

#### Features

-   Package Manager: Added a UI for users to manage their Scoped Registries from inside the Editor. Also added a popup alert for when Scoped Registries are added to their project from outside that Scoped Registries management UI. The Scoped Registries management UI is automatically opened when the popup shows.

#### System Requirements
