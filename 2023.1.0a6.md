#### Changes

-   Android: Android SDK must have cmdline-tools component installed now. Unity will ignore tools component.

-   Android: Default gradle templates have changed significantly with new Gradle and AGP versions. Gradle templates in existing projects will have to be recreated based on new default templates when upgrading projects created with previous Unity versions.

-   Android: JDK 11 is required now to build Android apps.

-   Android: Removed editor UI option which allowed to choose between R8 and Proguard tools to minify code. New AGP version doesn\'t have an option to minify using proguard. Instead R8 is always used.

-   Android: Unity Now uses Android Gradle Plugin 7.1.2 by default.

-   Android: Unity Now uses Gradle 7.2 by default.

-   Animation: Added support for Physics SimulationMode and Physics2D SimulationMode2D in the Animator and Animation component.

-   Apple TV: Changed the minimum supported OS version to tvOS13.

-   Asset Bundles: When the Asset Bundle cache layout was changed in 2017, an automatic migration codepath was added to check for asset bundles in the old cache location and move them into the new cache, so that end users would not need to re-download the bundles just because the cache layout changed. As 5 years have now passed, it is unlikely that this automatic migration still has any value, so the behavior has been removed.
