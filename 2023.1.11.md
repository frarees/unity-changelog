-   Burst: Added support for default interface methods.

-   Burst: Added support for string interpolation in exception messages.

-   Editor: Improve performance when fetching artifacts that are missing (e.g link to an artifact deleted from the project).([UUM-22002](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-animator-window-is-slow-when-displaying-a-blend-tree-with-many-nodes))

#### Changes

-   Burst: Direct call is now correctly disabled for methods that are decorated with both` [BurstCompile] `and` [UnmanagedCallersOnly] `attributes (such methods shouldn\'t be called directly from managed code).

#### Fixes

-   Android: Fixed custom keystore creation via the keystore manager.(UUM-46300)

-   Burst: Fixed a compile-time performance regression in 1.8.7 that could result in slower Burst compilation and increased memory usage during compilation.

-   Burst: Fixed a possible source of invalid alignment, avx2 storing to stack was given a slot with the wrong alignment.

-   Burst: Fixed burst not being able to find external function leading to crashing the Editor.

-   Burst: Fixed Burst sometimes returning wrong value for static readonly fields or static constructors.

-   Burst: Fixed compiler crash when compiling different assemblies that define methods or types with the exact same name and namespace.

-   Burst: Fixed error when trying to use direct call to a nested protected class.

-   Burst: Fixed that converting a negated unsigned type to a float would produce a mismatching value in Burst versus .Net/Mono.

-   Burst: Fixed that jobs wouldn\'t be Burst compiled for player builds with high stripping.

-   Burst: Fixed that the Burst Inspector handled negation of unsigned types differently than .Net for static readonly fields or static constructors.

-   Burst: Fixed using Armv9 target in the Burst Inspector not formatting the assembly.

-   Burst: Fixed wrong alignment for v128 when doing an indirect access.

-   Burst: Fixed` System.NotImplementedException: Unimplemented Instruction Extension Tail_ `error when the code contained tail-calls.

-   Burst: Fixed` uint `to` float `conversion edge-case.

-   Burst: Prevented Burst emitting errors even when Burst was disabled via the` --burst-disable-compilation `command line option.

-   Burst: Under some conditions (if the error in compilation occurred in a location that didn\'t have valid debug information), building a player might not generate any files, and not display any errors.

-   Documentation: Updated \"Applying default presets to Assets by folder\" documentation example to prevent an import infinite loop.([UUM-44046](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/projects-are-not-opening-due-to-an-infinite-loop-when-a-script-with-the-onpreprocessasset-function-from-the-documentation-is-present))
