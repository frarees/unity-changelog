## Release notes

### Improvements

-   Editor: Added additional logging when the MonoDevelop script editor was opened on OSX.
-   iOS: Added support for iPhone 6 & iPhone 6 Plus.
-   iOS: Display the number of finished files in AOT cross-compile progress bar.
-   Linux: Implemented screen-fullscreen command line option.

-   Physics: \'OnMouseDown\' and \'OnMouseUp\' callbacks for 3D physics now don\'t take priority over 2D physics, they can run simultaneously.
-   Physics: \'OnMouseDown\' and \'OnMouseUp\' callbacks for both 2D and 3D colliders now correctly use camera near/far plane distance.
-   Scripting: Properly validate class constraint on generics with reference type constraint.
-   Shaders: Fixed #include processing that are nested in #ifdef blocks in surface shaders.
-   Shaders: Fixed faceforward() for OpenGL platforms.
-   Shaders: VFACE pixel shader semantic translates more properly to OpenGL platforms now (values of -1 or 1, not 0 or 1 like before).
-   Substance: Fixed regression where valid runtime cache data would not be used and ProceduralTextures would be needlessly recomputed.
-   Substance: ProceduralTextures are no longer corrupted when switching color space in the editor.
-   Substance: ProceduralTextures are no longer corrupted when switching the masterTextureLimit in the editor.
