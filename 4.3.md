#### Sprite Packing (Atlasing), PRO only feature

-   Atlas is defined by changing the PackingTag property in texture importer.
-   Packing is based on the generated mesh.
-   Packing will respect texture import settings and will only pack textures together if format, usage mode, color mode, compression quality, filter mode and mip-map settings match.
-   Window/Sprite Packer menu option opens a new window for inspecting the automatically generated sprite atlases.
-   Decision of which sprites to place into which atlases can be fully customized by implementing a custom sprite packer policy (UnityEditor.Sprites.IPackerPolicy).
-   Packing is completely transparent to the user, works in Play mode and is compatible with asset bundles.

### Animation Features

#### New Animation Window has arrived

-   Heavily influenced by the standard \"dope sheets\".
-   Only animated properties are shown in the property view (left side of the window).
-   Sprite animation is possible by animating the SpriteRendrerer component.
-   Sprites are shown in the dopesheet when SpriteRenderer is unfolded from the left side property view.
-   \'Add Curve\' menu added. Shows all properties that can be animated on selected GameObject.
-   Animation Window now supports Mecanim. Animations can be added to the animator controller from the Animation window. Animations can be modified in the AnimationWindow too.
-   Added \'Curves\' button to menu bar. Changes between dopesheet and curve editor. \'C\' key assigned for keyboard shortcut
-   Added \'Samples\' field to menu bar. Changes clip sample value per second.
-   Added toggle field for animating boolean properties. Created boolean curves use \'Constant\' as default key tangent.
-   \'F\' will focus on whole clip, or shown curves, if nothing is selected

#### Mecanim improvements

-   Add a new option \"Optimize Game Objects\" in ModelImporter inspector. In short, this makes character rigs much faster.
    -   When turned on, the game object transform hierarchy of the imported character will be removed and is instead stored in the Avatar and Animator component.
    -   The SkinnedMeshRenderers of the character will then directly use the Mecanim internal skeleton, so that we can get rid of all the Transforms which used to be there, representing all the bones.
    -   This option will improve the performance of the animated characters. It is recommended to turn it on for the final product. In optimized mode skinned mesh matrix extraction is also multithreaded.
    -   When \"Optimize Game Objects\" is turned on, the user can specify a list of \"Extra Transforms to Expose\" in ModelImporter inspector. For example, if you want to attach a sword to the right hand, this acts as a mount point. The exposed transform is flattened in the game object hierarchy, even though it might be somewhere deep in skeleton hierarchy.
-   Mecanim supports animating any property including blend shapes properties, camera properties, script float properties, lights and most other float properties on components.
-   Support for events! Events are created in the animation window for writable Animation Clips attach to an Animator. Can also add AnimationEvents directly in the animation importer.
-   Various performance optimizations, especially in regards to generic mode.
-   Added Animator.Play and Animator.CrossFade scripting functions. These functions allow you at runtime to transition to any state in your controller.
-   Added AnimatorOverrideController, an AnimatorOverrideController allow you to override any clip from a controller with another one.
-   Loop time vs Loop pose, When an animation clip is already looping, no need to activate Loop Pose, Loop Time will make clip looping without modifying the pose.
-   Trigger parameter, a trigger is a boolean parameter that is reset by the controller when consumed by a transition.

### Editor Features

#### Editor Controls Overhaul

-   LookLikeControls and LookLikeInspector have been replaced with a single unified look.
-   New look has consistent styles, indentation and layout.
-   Keyboard navigation now works for all components and is improved for sliders and object fields.
-   The Inspector has a new Wide Mode that places controls in a more neatly aligned and vertically compact way.
-   Easier to write Editor GUI with consistent alignment.
-   Relevant new API:
    -   EditorGUIUtility.labelWidth and EditorGUIUtility.fieldWidth replaces the parameters in the now obsolete EditorGUIUtility.LookLikeControls function.
    -   EditorGUI.PrefixLabel has a new overload that doesn\'t need an id parameter.
    -   EditorGUILayout.GetControlRect is the best way to get a Rect for a standard sized Editor control.

#### Other Editor Features

-   Unity now ships with a brand new MonoDevelop 4.0.1!
-   Ability to build iOS target in Windows! It\'s still necessary to compile resulting Xcode project on a Mac.
-   Added global SortingLayers (see Tags & Layers window). Every Renderer can specify a layer and an in-layer order value for explicit ordering using. SpriteRenderer inspector exposes the two properties.
-   Layer locking for scene view. The layers dropdown in editor toolbar controls visibility or locking of layers (and locking of the new Sorting Layers). Locked layers are visible, but aren\'t pickable in the scene view.
-   Undo has been optimized for large scenes. Full scene undo support has been removed, all undo operations save only the necessary objects. SnapshotUndo support has been deprecated, instead Undo.RecordObject is to be used for all property modifications. Undo API has been revamped to make it clearer what functions should be used now.
-   Added a \"Default behavior\" property to Editor Properties to control default texture import behavior and default scene view mode.
-   Added an option to the new project wizard to select default editor behavior (2D/3D).
-   BuildPipeline methods now have parameters to output CRC checksums of generated AssetBundles.
-   New Highlighter editor API for highlighting elements in the editor. Useful for in-editor tutorials and similar.
-   Asset Pipeline: Only new assets or assets where the actual content has change will get imported. Changing the time stamp of an asset will no longer cause a reimport.
-   Asset Pipeline: .meta files are now always turned on. From Project Settings -\> Editor you can choose to hide them if you are not using version control.
-   Added ability to specify external script editor\'s args, including file and line info. (Windows editor only).

### Graphics Features

#### Blendshapes

-   Unity now supports blendshapes (also known as \"morph targets\").
-   You can drive the blendshapes using name based binding from Mecanim or legacy animation system.
-   Blendshape curves are imported from FBX files, but you can also record them in the animation window.

#### Culling in Unity has been rewritten

-   Now it\'s much faster across the board. Umbra occlusion culling is used to cull away point lights that don\'t contribute to the final image; and to drastically reduce number of shadow casters from directional lights.
-   Umbra: Incremental baking of occlusion culling data.
-   Umbra: Portal culling occluder rasterization has been greatly optimized.
-   Umbra: PVS culling has been removed. Occluder rasterization is always used because PVS often gave to inaccurate results and bake times were huge.
-   Umbra: Directional shadow caster occlusion culling drastically reduces the amount of directional shadow casting objects to be rendered.
-   Umbra: Point light occlusion culling and connectivity tests are used to remove local lights that do not contribute to the final image.
-   Vertex point lights that are outside of the frustum are faded out with the range of the light.
-   General culling performance optimizations, by optimizing data layout, code optimizations etc.

#### Other graphics features

-   Deferred: A number of light rendering optimizations for deferred rendering, making the light pass faster. Side effect is that only up to 4 bits of the stencil buffer are left available, instead of up to 5.
-   Render Texture improvements:
    -   Added Camera.SetTargetBuffers for multiple render target (MRT) support.
    -   Ability to render into a specified mip level of a RenderTexture. Create a mipmapped RT, turn off automatic mip generation with RenderTexture. generateMips=false; and use new Graphics.SetRenderTarget overloads to specify mip level to render into.
    -   Ability to render into a speficied cubemap RenderTexture face; new overload in Graphics.SetRenderTarget. Added SystemInfo.supportsRenderToCubemap.
-   Graphics: Added Mesh.UploadMeshData, to trigger VBO creation and possibly system-side copy unload.
-   MaterialPropertyBlock got improved:
    -   Added Renderer.GetPropertyBlock, and MaterialPropertyBlock GetVector,GetFloat etc. functions.
    -   MaterialPropertyBlocks can have texture properties now.
    -   Objects with custom material property blocks (renderer.SetPropertyBlock) can be batched now, if their properties are the same.
-   Terrain: Optimized terrain rendering and reduced memory usage.
-   Android: Enabled multi-threaded rendering on OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0. This takes advantage of asynchronous multiprocessing architectures like Qualcomm Snapdragon CPUs and enables more efficient rendering of both OpenGLES 2.0 and 3.0, both currently supported on Adreno GPUs.
-   Android: ASTC (Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression) format support.
-   Improved system memory usage of statically batched geometry.
-   It is now possible to set the fade time on flares. This changes how fast a flare will fade in or out when appearing or disappearing from the screen.
-   Added Texture2D.LoadRawTextureData for loading already-made (e.g. DXT/PVRTC compressed) raw data.
-   Allow for overriding Hidden/Internal-Flare, Hidden/Internal-Halo and Hidden/Internal-CombineDepthNormals shaders.
-   Added Max Particles script binding to Shuriken particle systems.
-   Dynamic batching support for point, line, and quad mesh topologies.
-   Added support for some DirectX 11.1 features (low precision shader variables, UAVs in all shader stages, logical blending operations etc.); note this works on DX11.1 runtime only (Windows 8 and up).
-   Exposed Light.cookieSize to scripts.

#### Shader related features

-   Material.renderQueue is serialized now. You can change it from custom inspector or script, and it will be saved.
-   Most of fixed function states (like blend, cull, depth test, stencil modes; polygon offsets etc.) can be driven by material parameters now. For example \"Blend \[MySrcBlend\] \[\_MyDstBlend\]\", with \_MySrcBlend and \_MyDstBlend being float variables. See enums in UnityEngine.Rendering for the mode values. \_Note: in this alpha, global shader properties can\'t drive be used for this.
-   MaterialPropertyDrawers, just like property drawers, but for shaders and material inspectors! e.g. you can do \[MaterialToggle(FANCY_ON)\] before a float shader property, and this will display it as a checkbox; and will enable FANCY_ON keyword when checked.
-   Added \"by property ID\" functions to set/get material properties; use Shader.PropertyToID to compute ID just once. No need to pass strings all the time.
-   By enabling SceneFX in the scene view materials in the viewport will update as they would at runtime (taking time into account).
-   Material inspectors now take time into account. Your materials will update in realtime in the inspector window.
-   Somewhat more sane error reporting - now gives hints in error messages about #pragma target 3.0 or #pragma glsl, and reports way less almost identical errors when you make typos.
-   Vertex lit shaders can access all 8 vertex light lights instead of only first 4 in custom shader programs. Also, spot light information (spot direction & spot attenuation) can be accessed.
-   Added Material.EnableKeyword and DisableKeyword.
-   Added Material.SetInt/GetInt, and Shader.SetGlobalInt. In ShaderLab Properties block, \"Int\" can be a property type similar to \"Float\". Note that all these are just aliases for floats.
-   Added ShaderUtil.CreateShaderAsset this takes a text shader and returns a compiled shader.
