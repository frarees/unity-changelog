## Release notes

### Features

-   Support for iOS 64-bit builds using il2cpp.

### Changes

-   The Flash build target is no longer supported from this release onwards.

### Improvements

-   Audio: Added WWW.GetAudioClipCompressed. Allows AudioClips obtained via WWW class to be loaded into memory compressed, similar to \"Compressed in Memory\" import option.
-   Graphics: Added MaterialPropertyBlock.Set\*() methods to overwrite existing values in a MaterialPropertyBlock instead of adding duplicates.
-   iOS: Add basic launch screen support.
-   iOS: Expose "set pause" as ObjC API.
-   Linux: Added more font fallbacks for Latin and CJK.
-   Oculus GearVR: Enabled low latency audio support.
-   Oculus Plugin: Future Oculus Plugin releases will no longer require Direct_To_Rift.exe
-   Oculus: Added VR friendly splash screen for Unity Free.
-   Scene View: DrawGizmo attribute now reports errors when used incorrectly, and has better documentation.
-   Standalone: Screen.dpi implemented for OSX and Windows standalone platforms.
-   UI: Change Text.m_Text to protected and Text.text to virtual. In this way users can have control over the text contents when extending Text.
-   UI: Expose EventSystem.firstSelected to API.
-   WebPlayer UnityObject: It is now possible to identify the webplayer runtime version before loading content. This makes it possible to load different content based on the runtime version already installed.
