## Release notes

### Improvements

-   Added support for the 5th generation iPad.
-   AssetBundles: Reduced SerializedFile memory usage when reading streams inside AssetBundles.
-   Build Pipeline: Exceptions thrown during the build process (e.g. by user callbacks) are now treated the same as logged errors, from a reporting and StrictMode point of view.
