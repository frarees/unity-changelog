## Release Notes

### Fixes

-   Android: Fixed rendering on Tegra 3 devices.
-   Android: Fixed Vulkan rendering errors on Adreno devices
-   Android: A friendly user message is now shown when using a JDK other than 8. ([956425](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-builds-fail-with-java-9-jdk-and-unable-to-list-target-platforms-error), 1060076)
-   Animation: Fixed wrong CurveModifiedType sent in function callback onCurveWasModified when changing animation events in clip. ([1047683](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animationutility-dot-oncurvewasmodified-invokes-curvemodified-with-an-unknown-binding))
-   Editor: Fixed editor crashes when calling EditorUtility.SetDirty(null). ([1060898](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-in-object-setdirty-when-passing-a-null-into-the-editorutility-dot-setdirty), 1061076)
-   GI: Correctly sample area lights from probes in Progressive Lightmapper. ([1033074](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/plm-sh-values-of-some-light-probes-are-unexpectedly-dark-when-using-area-light))
-   GI: Fix low CPU utilization when baking with the progressive lightmapper ([1013830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/plm-cpu-is-underutilized-when-baking-multi-lightmaps))
-   Graphics: Fixed a crash (out of bound array access) when some empty RenderPass is used in SRP context. ([1002440](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-in-gfxdevice-beginrenderpass-if-renderpass-dot-subpass-does-nothing))
-   Graphics: Fixed possible crash during shader warmup when using Vulkan.
-   Graphics: Fixed Vulkan validation errors during texture uploads.
-   Graphics: Fixed a resource leak issue with SRP BlendState and Graphics Jobs
-   OSX: Fixed framerate being limited in batch mode when Application.targetFrameRate == -1. (1022906)
-   Package Manager: Fixed not being able to create assets from drop down menu if any projectSettings are opened in inspector. ([975732](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assets-are-not-created-from-drop-down-menu-if-any-projectsettings-are-opened-in-inspector))
-   Particles: Particles are now allowed to use dynamic batching and GPU instancing at the same time for mesh particle systems. Batching allows for a single material setup between systems, and instancing allows for efficient rendering of mesh particles.
-   Scripting: Fixed \"using static\" directive causing Unity to not find the class in the script ([962043](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/default-argument-value-makes-the-editor-recognize-a-script-as-not-valid),[962275](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/using-static-directive-causes-unity-to-not-find-the-class-in-the-script))
-   Scripting: Fixed crash when dragging a script with a UI or RectTransform component requirement to a GameObject. ([1036699](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-when-adding-a-script-with-requirecomponent-typeof-text-to-a-parent-gameobject-with-no-text-component), 1057076)
-   Scripting: Fixed random memory corruption and crash usually surfaced during liveness.
-   Timeline: Fixed parent constraint does not work in timeline preview. (1057525)
-   XR: Fixed crash that causes the VR device to stop rendering when render texture size is too large and not a power of 2. (1027366)
-   XR: Fixed issue where HMD\'s would only render a single frame and black everywhere else when Game tab isn\'t visible during play mode. ([878454](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vr-during-play-mode-headset-rendering-breaks-if-scene-window-is-focused))
