### 2020.3.35f1 Release Notes

On Android, Bluetooth audio state is basically global, so Unity Audio now only makes the bare minimum changes to this state. We may still call startBluetoothSco and stopBluetoothSco when starting or re-initializing the audio output engine and when starting/stopping the Unity microphone. We may also call AudioManager.setMode when starting/stopping a Bluetooth mic through the Unity microphone APIs, but that\'s it. (1418634)

-   GI: Removed an assert from when switching to a lighting data asset from a scene that is unloaded but still in the hierarchy. ([1318347](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-manager-equals-null-error-is-shown-after-changing-lighting-data-asset-file-for-the-active-scene))
