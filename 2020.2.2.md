-   Desktop:

    -   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    -   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    -   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

-   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.

-   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.

-   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.
