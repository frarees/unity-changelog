## Release notes

### New Platforms and Licensing

-   Windows Store Apps (\"WSA\", for both x86 and ARM) and Windows Phone 8 support. Pro version of WSA/WP8 is free for Unity Pro owners!
-   BlackBerry 10 support.
-   Now free: all \"Basic\" mobile licenses.
-   Now free: realtime shadows (one directional light only; hard shadows only).
-   Now free: text-based serialization of materials, prefabs, scenes etc. for easier version control.
-   Now free: NavMesh baking (OffMeshLinks still require Pro).

### Graphics Features

-   Anti-aliased RenderTextures. Implemented on D3D9, D3D11, OpenGL, OpenGL ES 2.0 (iOS and some Android devices via GL_IMG_multisampled_render_to_texture), OpenGL ES 3.0.
-   Image Effects, a batch of new goodies and improvements (update Image Effects package!)
    -   Ambient Obscurance: Added \"Screen Space Ambient Obscurance\" effect, like old SSAO but better quality, faster and scales better to large resolutions.
    -   Bloom: Added mobile oriented \"Bloom (Optimized)\" effect; not as fancy as Bloom one but faster.
    -   Blur: Added mobile oriented \"Blur (Optimized)\" effect.
    -   Tilt Shift: Replaced old effect with \"Tilt Shift (Lens Blur)\" one; better quality and HDR support.
    -   Camera Motion Blur: Added \"Reconstruction Disc\" mode, quality tweaks to existing modes.
    -   Vignetting: Optimized performance and improved UI.
    -   Edge detection: Removed old simple \"Edge Detection (Color)\" effect, added it as a new mode into Edge Detection effect.
    -   Reorganized image effects menu structure to be more logical.
-   Stencil buffer access (requires Unity Pro). Shaders can define stencil buffer operations that they perform, for optimizations or special effects.
-   Shadows: Implemented static & dynamic batching for shadow casters & shadow collector pass. Note: many shadow casters can be batched even if they use different materials! They will be batched as long as the actual shadow caster shader & material properties affecting it are the same.
-   Shuriken: Collision event callback scripting interface. Efficient callbacks on GameObjects and ParticleSystems are issued when Shuriken particle collisions occur. Per particle callback data include collision positions, incident velocities, surface normals and Collider references allowing developers to, say, cause + damage to GameObjects and apply forces to RigidBodies.v
-   GPU Skinning! (requires Unity Pro)
    -   Completely automatic, no custom shaders needed.
    -   Works on DirectX 11 (via stream-out), OpenGL ES 3.0 (via transform feedback) and Xbox 360 (via memexport). Other platforms will continue to use CPU skinning.
-   OpenGL ES 3.0 support for Android:
    -   ES3 has nicer shadow filtering, ETC2 texture compression, GPU skinning via transform feedback, HDR rendering, multiple render targets, derivative instructions in shaders etc.
    -   A new option in Player Settings, next to ES1.x and 2.0 devices.
    -   Requires a GPU that can do ES3, for example Qualcomm Adreno 3xx or ARM Mali T6xx.
    -   Note that the official Android version does not support ES3 yet. So to test it you should install ES3 drivers directly from GPU makers (e.g. Qualcomm).
-   Deferred Lighting is now enabled on Android and iOS.
    -   Requires depth texture support and at least a 512MB RAM device.
    -   Note, it might still be too slow for big games scenes on anything but latest devices, so use with care.
-   Added possibility to create Texture2D directly from native texture; Texture2D.CreateExternalTexture. This is mostly useful when your native code plugin creates textures itself.

### Editor Features

-   Integrated version control support for Perforce.
    -   Do common Perforce operations right inside Unity editor.
    -   We\'ve made the integrated version control system extensible; support for more VCS will be coming later. Or you can write your own VCS plugin, see our plugin page on github.
-   Platform switching, player building and asset importing can be cancelled now! How cool is that?
-   Custom GameView resolutions & aspect ratios. Custom settings are saved per project for easy sharing through version control (ProjectSettings/GameViewSizes.asset).
-   Preset Libraries: You can now save the following types as presets:
    -   Curves in the Curve Editor and Particle System Curve Editor.
    -   Gradients in the Gradient Editor.
    -   Colors in the Color Picker.
    -   Create new libraries either as personal libraries (saved in preferences) or shared libraries (saved in the project folder).
-   Added a Quad primitive ;)
-   Memory Profiler: Now shows the objects that have references to another loaded object. This can help pinpoint why a given object is in memory.
-   Shader importer can have default textures specified. When you initially set a shader on a material or reset a material the textures will be set to these default textures.
-   Texture importer now has \"Alpha is Transparency\" setting, which does color dilation to fix edge artifacts on semitransparent textures. It is enabled by default for GUI textures.

### Mobile Features

-   Android: Added support for Android Library Projects (no compilation support, so the libraries have to be pre-compiled).
-   Android: AndroidJavaProxy - Support for implementing Java interfaces in C#.
-   Android: Editor can now update the Android SDK if it does not match the required dependencies.
-   iOS: Added CrashReporter API for crash detection and extraction (requires Unity Pro).
-   iOS: Now you can setup iOS PlayerSettings, texture import overrides and build iOS AssetBundles from Windows Editor. Building an actual iOS player still requires Mac OS X & Xcode.
-   iOS: WebCamTexture can be set non-readable (prior to playback), which allows it to output from camera directly to texture, avoiding extra memory copies.
-   Editor: When in mobile graphics emulation mode, editor will show a warning when RenderTexture usage is not optimal for tile-based or multi-GPU systems. Use RenderTexture.MarkRestoreExpected() to suppress the warning if needed.

### Other Features

-   Audio: Added Bypass Listener and Bypass Reverb Zones properties that enable turning off listener effects independently from the effects on the audio source. Thus, Bypass Effects only turns off the effects on the AudioSource, and the 3 flags can be combined freely.
-   Audio: Added Disable Audio property in Audio project settings to deactivate the audio system in standalone builds. Note that this also affects the audio of MovieTextures. In the editor the audio system is still on and will support previewing audio clips, but AudioSource.Play calls and playOnAwake will not be handled in order to simulate behavior of the standalone build.
-   Audio: Added \"Prepare iOS For Recording\" property in Player Settings (iOS \> Other Settings in the inspector). Turning it on will avoid the stalls that otherwise happen when starting or stopping the Microphone object.
-   Editor: Editor extensions can now get a callback when Unity is about to open an asset. Use this callback to open an asset inside Unity before its opened in an external tool. Decorate a static method with the attribute UnityEditor.Callbacks.OnOpenAsset.
-   Linux: Added basic webcam support for video4linux2-supported devices.
-   Linux: Implement headless player; this will not require Xlib (requires Unity Pro).
-   Mac OS X: 64 bit standalone player support (x86_64 and Universal).
-   Mecanim: Avatar Creation API, for avatar creation from scripts at runtime or in the editor.
-   Mecanim: Synchronized Layers option to override state durations.
-   Mecanim: You can now set the default layer weight in the editor for your animator controller layer.

### Changes

-   Asset bundles built in prior versions of Unity are no longer compatible with Unity 4.2 (this has been necessary because of changes to how built-in resources are handled).
-   AssetDatabase.ImportPackage and AssetDatabase.ExportPackage can now be called repeatedly from within the same iteration of the game update loop (previously, successive calls would overwrite the buffered state of the previous one).
-   Audio: 7.1 content can now be loaded in the editor (previously only 5.1 was allowed).
-   Editor: Add MeshRenderer component dependency for TextMesh component.
-   Editor: NavMeshLayers editing is now located as a tab in the Navigation Window.
-   Editor: Terrain menu functionality moved to Terrain Inspector. Now you create a terrain by GameObject \> Create Other \> Terrain. Terrain settings previously in the menu are under Settings tab in terrain inspector.
-   Font colors are now applied as vertex colors, instead of by setting the color on the material. This makes it work better with markup tags in rich text strings. The color property in the font importer has been removed, and instead there are now color properties on the GUIText and TextMesh components to let you set the color of text objects per instance instead of per font.
-   Graphics: Disabled multisampling on NVIDIA cards on OS X earlier than 10.9 in Mac Web Player, due to driver issues.
-   Graphics: Majority of built-in shaders are now only included into your game data if they are actually used. This saves about 200 kilobytes off your mobile game size if you\'re not using many built-in ones. If you need some built-in shaders to be available without explicit references to them (to make Shader.Find etc. work), set them up in Edit -\> Project Settings -\> Graphics (by default Diffuse shader is always included).
-   Mac OS X Editor: The Editor on OS X will now allow symlinks in project folders to match Windows behavior. This can be used to share assets across projects, but is not recommended unless you know exactly what you are doing.
-   Made several Unity API calls which had been undocumented for many years properly deprecated.
-   NavMesh: \"Reset\" button in navmesh bake window is moved to window menu item.
-   Resources.LoadAll() now permits a trailing slash when given a folder name.
-   Web Player: the \"Release Channels\" context menu item will now only be visible when the Alt/Option key is pressed when opening the context menu.

### Improvements

-   Android: Stylus support.
-   Android: Support for xxhdpi resolution icons.
-   Android: AndroidJNIHelper and AndroidJava classes will now throw exceptions on failed invocations.
-   Android: Enhanced performance of AndroidJava and reduced the load on the dalvik GC.
-   Android: If possible, use native sensors (accelerometer, compass, etc) instead of routing it through Java.
-   Android: Improved error messages when build fails; added Retry option when device deployment fails; automatically create adb tunnel for profiler.
-   Android: OBB is now exported in the root folder when exporting an android project.
-   Android: Remove Eclipse project support in favor of Android project support.
-   Asset Bundles: Compressed AssetBundles built with 4.2 or later will have reduced runtime memory usage when decompressing.
-   Audio: Added a more informative error message when the audio device is changed during work in the editor or at runtime (i.e. when plugging in a screen that has built-in audio device such as HDMI screens).
-   Building: Show a warning when assembly\'s internal and file names don\'t match. This can cause issues on platforms that do AOT.
-   Editor: Added EditorGUIUtility.ShowObjectPicker to let editor extensions use it on demand.
-   Editor: Added a Select Prefab item in the Hierarchy View context menu.
-   Editor: Added EditorWindow.maximized bool. Use this to query if a window is maximized, set it to maximize/unmaximize a window. Is always false if the window is not docked.
-   Editor: Gradient API now has alphaKeys and colorKeys properties.
-   Editor: New #SCRIPTNAME_LOWER# token for use in script templates.
-   Editor: Popups, buttons, color pickers, etc. in the inspector can now be opened by pressing Space.
-   Editor: Show warning in inspector when you have non-power-of-two texture that cannot be compressed.
-   Editor: Switching between DX9 and DX11 in player settings does not require editor restart now.
-   Editor: Trying to open a project that is already open in another Unity instance will now simply display an error and then bring up the project selector (except in batch mode where it keeps triggering a fatal error and exits).
-   Graphics: Optimized sorting of renderable objects for smaller CPU load.
-   Graphics: Exposed Light.alreadyLightmapped to scripts.
-   Graphics: reduced memory footprint of non-readable meshes.
-   Graphics: Added WebCamTexture.videoVerticallyMirrored. Use Case: on iOS, when you use non-readable webcam texture, GL texture will be created on top of camera\'s target pixel buffer, which is vertically \"flipped\".
-   iOS: Ability to disable \"Replace\" button when overwriting existing build.
-   iOS: Added Objective-C VideoPlayer, to playback video to view or to a texture.
-   iOS: Enforced keyboard to be shown on main thread (to play nicely with iOS6).
-   iOS: Improved support for AppController subclassing and unity view integration with native UI.
-   iOS: In case of unhandled exceptions iOS player now will generate crash report instead of exiting silently.
-   iOS: Made Unity iOS apps PIE compatible.
-   iOS: Added iPhone.vendorIdentifier and iPhone.advertisingIdentifier with iPhone.advertisingTrackingEnabled APIs for better manual control of what device ID to use.
-   iOS: Xcode project cleaned up a bit.
-   iOS: Native VideoPlayback can be now paused/resumed. You can seek and check if it is playing.
-   iOS: Added UNITY_VERSION macro support for native code in trampoline. We also added a UNITY_4\_2_0 macro to make it future-proof (we will add macros like that for future releases too). We now support these ways of checking the version:
    -   you can use it like MSC_VER macro, i.e. if you want some code to be enabled only when using unity 4.4.1 or newer, do #if UNITY_VERSION \>= 441.
    -   you can do it in a way that resembles iOS SDK versioning, e.g. for version 4.4.1 and newer #ifdef UNITY_4\_4_1.
    -   you can combine them, e.g. #if defined(UNITY_4\_4_1) && UNITY_VERSION \< UNITY_4\_4_1
-   Linux: Improved inter-application copy/paste.
-   Linux: Add fullscreen scaling fallback for devices that don\'t support GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit.
-   Mecanim: Allow scrolling when adding transition.
-   Mecanim: Return warning message in console to user when we detect an invalid avatar while importing.
-   Mobile: Optimized a bunch of rendering places to be more tiled-GPU friendly (as is common on mobile). This includes shadows, deferred lighting and most of image effects.
-   Mobile: Added RenderTexture.DiscardContents with separate flags for color/depth discard.
-   Mobile: Greatly improved performance of fixed function shaders on OpenGL ES 2.0. There\'s no reason to use ES 1.1 anymore.
-   Mobile: Switched to one FBO object per RenderTexture; performance improvement with render texture switches.
-   NavMesh: General crowd performance improvements.
-   Profiler: Now roughly estimates how much application binary and loaded libraries take.
-   Profiler: Open webstreams (for Asset Bundles etc.) report their used sizes.

-   Scripting: Added HideFlags.None enum value.
-   Scripting: While compiling C# scripts, you can now use classes from System.Xml.Linq namespace.
-   Shaders: Ability to output custom Z buffer value from shaders. Previously, a bug in Cg compiler prevented this on D3D9, we\'ve worked around that. Note that some platforms (OpenGL ES 2.0, Flash) don\'t have ability to write custom values into Z buffer from pixel shaders.
-   Shaders: Add ability to override how lightmaps are applied in surface shaders.
-   Shadows: Better sorting of shadow casters for GPU efficiency.
-   Shadows: Improved shadowmap filtering on OpenGL. It will use native GPU bilinear shadow filter when available, just like D3D9 and D3D11 does. No more \"shadows are worse on Mac than on Windows\"! Note: native shadowmap filtering disabled for Spot lights on Linux due to driver issues.
-   Shuriken: Added script binding for ParticleSystem simulation space.
-   Shuriken: Exposed particle axis of rotation to scripting API.
-   Standalone: Added \"fullscreen at native resolution\" player setting.
-   Standalone: Added player setting for single instance mode.
-   Substance: Cloned ProceduralMaterials now inherit the original substance\'s animation rate.
-   Substance: It is now possible to reliably assign ProceduralTextures from a SBSAR to the shader associated to a ProceduralMaterial from another SBSAR.
-   Substance: ProceduralMaterial.ClearCache now takes effect immediately instead of being taken into account at next RebuildTextures call.
-   Substance: ProceduralTextures created from a cloned ProceduralMaterial now have the same name and \"RAW/Compressed\" format as the original textures.
-   Substance: Reimporting substances that have been modified in Play mode is now multithreaded.
-   Substance: Editor scripts can now modify a ProceduralMaterial\'s size/format/behaviour using SubstanceImporter.Get/SetPlatformTextureSettings.

### Upgrade guide

-   See \"Changes\" section above!
-   iOS: We renamed AppController.mm/h to UnityAppController.mm/h to highlight the fact that we now allow your own AppDelegate (derived from UnityAppController). If you have plugins including AppController.h you can simply include UnityAppController.h instead. If you have AppController.mm/h in Plugins/iOS folders you can merge and rename them. Anyway, we urge you to consider moving to new AppDelegate model: if you needed to do some view tweaking, now you can do it without ever touching Unity\'s trampoline, meaning no upgrade pains.
-   Deprecation heads-up. In the next release (4.3), we plan to drop:
    -   OpenGL ES 1.1 support on mobile (set Rendering Path to VertexLit in player settings and it should be very similar experience on OpenGL ES 2.0)
    -   Pre-DX9 GPU support on PC (Windows/Mac/Linux). This means, NVIDIA GPUs before GeForce FX (2003), AMD GPUs before Radeon 9500 (2002) and Intel GPUs before GMA 900 (2004). Shader Model 2.0 will be the new minimum requirement.
-   MonoDevelop may fail to start correctly on Windows if an old version of Gtk# is installed on the system. Please uninstall this version, and install a newer one if still needed.
