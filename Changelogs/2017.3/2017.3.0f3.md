2017.3.0f3 Release Notes (diff since 2017.3.0f2 at the end)
-----------------------------------------------------------

### SDKs

*   Vuforia: SDK v.7.0.36 [link](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Release_Notes/Vuforia-SDK-Release-Notes.html)

### Features

*   Analytics: Added support to capture VR device refresh rate, dimension, aspect ratio, HMD tracking and Controllers tracking as part of device info and device status events.
    
*   Animation: Added support for integer and enum animation.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added `AssetDatabase.ForceReserializeAssets` API. This method allows you to proactively load, upgrade, and write back to disk any Asset or Scene files in the project. When project upgrades cause serialization changes to Assets and metafiles, Unity writes these changes to disk separately from regular development iterations.
    
*   Editor: Added assembly definition files for script compilation pipeline in the editor. This allows you to define your own managed assemblies based on scripts inside a folder. Splitting your project's scripts into multiple assemblies can greatly reduce script compilation times in the Editor. Note that the latest version of Visual Studio Tools for Unity is required for this feature to work with solution and project generation for Visual Studio.
    
*   Editor: Added events: `MouseEnter`, `MouseLeave`, `MouseOver`, `MouseOut`, `AttachToPanel`, `DetachFromPanel`, `PostLayout`.
    
*   Editor: Added Focus events that notify UIElements when they gain or lose focus (the focused element receives keyboard input), and a focus ring, which is a circular list of UIElements that gives the order in which they receive the focus when you press Tab or Shift+Tab.
    
*   Editor: Added the Transform Tool, a single Gizmo you can use to move, rotate and scale in the Unity Editor.
    
*   Editor: You can now use DX12 API in the Editor.
    
*   Facebook: Segmented the uploader for the Facebook platform.
    
*   GI: Added support for HDR compressed lightmaps (BC6H) on PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. To enable this, go to Player Settings and set the **Lightmap Encoding** option to **High Quality**.
    
*   Graphics: Added a new method, `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture`. Use this to save screenshots taken with `ScreenCapture` as Textures in the Editor.
    
*   Graphics: Added Crunch compression support for ETC\_RGB4 and ETC2\_RGBA8 textures. Improved compression ratio and speed for DXT Crunch.
    
*   Graphics: Added Dynamic Resolution as an engine feature, debuting on Xbox One platform.
    
*   Graphics: Added support for multisampled Textures in Shaders. To use a multi-sampled Texture in a Shader, declare it as `Texture2DMS` (or, for example, float for a single-channel texture), and then sample as described in Microsoft's documentation on [Texture2DMS::Load methods](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn366998(v=vs.85).aspx). You must create the corresponding `RenderTexture` with the `bindMS` flag set on the `RenderTextureDescriptor`, or set the `bindTextureMS` flag after creation on the `RenderTexture` itself.
    
*   Graphics: Support for 32 bit Mesh index buffers:
    
    *   By default, meshes larger than 65k vertices get imported with a 32 bit index buffer. Smaller meshes still use 16 bit indices.
    *   Added **Index Format** setting to Mesh Importer to override this behavior.
    *   Added `Mesh.indexFormat` to scripting API for Meshes created at run time.
*   Kernel: Added new argument `-systemallocator`. This disables Engine management of allocations, and instead uses system allocations. This is useful when using external tools for memory debugging.
    
*   Particles: Added a new Speed Modifier option in the Particle System Velocity Module. Use this to control particle speeds without changing their directions. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_3_feature_particle_velocity_speed_modifier.png)
    
*   Particles: Added Unlit and Surface shaders for use with Particle Systems. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_3_feature_particle_shaders.png)
    
*   Particles: Ribbonized Particle Trails. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_3_feature_particle_ribbons.png)
    
*   Physics: Exposed a new broadphase algorithm called Multi-Box Pruning, which is based on subdividing the world boundaries. This helps to overcome the performance issues in the standard sweep-and-prune approach, by exluding the excess checks of bodies that are far away but overlap each other along one of the principal axes. Access Multi-Box Pruning in the Unity Editor's Physics Settings.
    
*   Physics: Exposed new settings in the Physics Manager: Contacts Generation, Contact Pairs, and Broadphase Type. This allows receiving the collision and trigger events from kinematic-kinematic and kinematic-static contact pairs.
    
*   Physics: Exposed `MeshCollider.cookingOptions`. Cooking options allow you to enable or disable certain features in Mesh cooking (the process of turning a normal Mesh into a Mesh that is suitable for use in the physics system). These options can help you achieve a much shorter cooking time. This API requires that you manually check the input data for validity.
    
*   Playables: Added new delay feature for IPlayables.
    
*   Playables: Added new Video Playables Integration.
    
*   Profiler: Added API for custom threads profiling: `Profiling.BeginThreadProfiling`, and `Profiling.EndThreadProfiling`.
    
*   Scripting: Added command line option "overrideMonoSearchPath" for desktop standalone players (OSX, Windows). "overrideMonoSearchPath" specifies an extra folder to search when Mono is loading assemblies. One intended use is to have two versions of the same project (such as a trial version and a full version). The Assets are the same, but the scripts are different. You can use this command line option to re-use the Assets, but load different scripts.
    
*   Scripting: Added Mono/.NET 2.0 support for Memory Profiler. See more on [GitHub](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/memoryprofiler).
    
*   Services: Analytics Standard Events and Tracker are now built into the editor.
    
*   Services: Performance Reporting Service: Added support for MacOS native crashes.
    
*   Video: Added panoramic 360/180 2D/3D video workflows.
    
*   Video: Introduced `UnityEngine.Media.MediaEncoder` to expose the VideoClipImporter encoders. This allows you to create movie files via script.
    
*   XR: Added a new option in the Windows MR Player Settings called **Enable Depth Buffer Sharing**. This allows the OS to better stabilize images without the need to manually set the focus plane. For more information about the benefits of image stabilization, see Microsoft's documentation on [Hologram Stability](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/hologram_stability).
    
*   XR: Added new UI to Daydream VR Device configuration, to support new 6DOF Standalone devices.
    
*   XR: Added support for Oculus Dash and Depth Buffer Sharing. Depth sharing makes opaque objects semi-transparent when in front of Dash. Both features can be toggled via the **Depth Buffer Sharing** and **Dash Support** checkboxes in the Oculus Player Settings
    
*   XR: Added XR support to Experimental Scriptable Render Pipelines.
    

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   Graphics: Removed DirectX 9 support from Windows Editor & Standalone. See [blog post](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/07/10/deprecating-directx-9/).

*   Android: Removed "Export as ADT project" option.
    
*   Asset Import: TextScriptImporter now recognises Markdown files (.md).
    
*   Editor: Added methods `EditorGUI.EnumFlagsField` and `EditorGUILayout.EnumFlagsField`, which respect the values of the enum type and support custom names for values 0 and ~0 (all bits set). Deprecated methods `EditorGUI.EnumMaskField`, `EditorGUILayout.EnumMaskField`, `EditorGUI.EnumMaskPopup`, and `EditorGUILayout.EnumMaskPopup`, which always assume values to be 1, 2, 4, 8 (and so on). ([896176](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editorguilayout-dot-enummaskfield-does-not-support-having-0-valued-consts))
    
*   Graphics: Removed allegorithmic Texture compressor.
    
*   Graphics: Resolution is no longer clamped when using custom shadow resolution on a light, allowing you to reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.
    
*   Graphics: Updated splash screen logo with new branding style.
    
*   Graphics: You can now access `imageContentsHash` for all Texture objects. This was previously only accessible using the `RenderTexture` API. ([952466](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/spr-slash-hdrrp-baking-a-single-reflection-probe-refreshes-the-preview-but-doesnt-refresh-the-reflection-probe-used-in-the-scene))
    
*   Licenses: Updated FBX license to require acceptance of FBX SDK license. See Autodesk's [License and Services Agreement 2015](https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/Company/docs/pdf/legal-notices-&-trademarks/Autodesk_FBX_SDK_2015_License_and_Services_Agreement.pdf).
    
*   Package Manager: Added `upmResetToEditorDefaults` command-line option and menu item to reset packages to Editor defaults.
    
*   Profiler: Improved profiler data serialization for Players - lower memory overhead, better performance.
    
*   Shaders: Concatenated matrix macros (e.g. UNITY\_MATRIX\_MVP) are now changed to static variables to avoid repeated calculations.
    
*   Substance: Deprecated built-in support for Substance Designer materials. This support will be removed in 2018.1. To continue using Substance Designer materials in Unity 2018.1, you need to install a suitable third-party external importer from the Asset Store.
    
*   UI: Unity no longer resets the LookDev camera when you create a new Scene. ([938493](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/lookdev-camera-slash-objects-is-reset-upon-creating-new-unity-scene))
    
*   XR: Improved the way XR devices pause/unpause applications, particularly when pausing as a result of application focus being lost. Unity now handles overlapping pause conditions correctly, regardless of the order in which they occur.
    
*   XR: Removed padding on double-wide texture used with Single Pass.
    

### Improvements

*   Animation: Added zoom in the Animator Window.
    
*   Animation: Entry, Exit and AnyState StateMachine Transitions can now be copy-pasted. ([921705](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/copy-and-pasting-animator-state-machine-loses-any-state-and-exit-transitions))
    
*   Animation: Framing a single key does not give proper context for manipulation in the curve editor, so we included neighbouring keys.
    
*   Asset Import: Added **Preserve Hierarchy** toggle to the Model Importer, to prevent Unity stripping the root transform when the model has a single root.
    
*   Asset Import: Added `AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessMaterial`.
    
*   Asset Import: Exposed `ModelImporter.MaterialLocation` to allow you to switch the Iaterial import location in `AssetPostprocessor` scripts.
    
*   Asset Import: Material workflow enhancement: added the ability to remap all embedded materials to existing material assets in the project, using the same heuristics as the legacy system
    
*   Asset Import: You can now skip Video Clip transcoding during import. If you do so, Unity uses a non-transcoded version of the video instead.
    
*   DX12: Native Rendering Plugin: Exposed and implemented native `RenderBuffer` resource retrieval, and fixed multithreading issues.
    
*   Editor: Added `UnityEngine.Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectedPlayer.Name`. This makes it easier for you to identify connected players.
    
*   Editor: Connected Players now only show debug logging in Editor console, not all of stdout. Added an option to disable player logging in the Editor console.
    
*   Editor: Fixed over 120 missing or incomplete tooltips in the Unity Editor.
    
*   Editor: If Edit mode and Play mode tests produce files without proper cleanup, Unity now logs a warning.
    
*   Editor: It is now possible to adjust the number of lines per log row in the Console window.
    
*   Editor: Updated UnityShaderCompiler tool for macOS and Linux to 64bit. This improves shader compilation performance.
    
*   Editor: You can now double-click a Scene file in the Build List to highlight Scenes in the Project view.
    
*   Editor: You can now select which Xcode version to build your project with on MacOS.
    
*   GI: Before, all trees, lightmap static or not, would cast baked shadows on Terrain. Now Unity honors the Static flag on the prefab.
    
*   GI: Fixed debugging textures for GI. It's now easier to tell when they should be availble, and why they might be missing.
    
*   GI: Legacy trees and prefabs that don't have a LOD group now cast baked shadows on Terrain. (685764)
    
*   GI: Made spot light and point light fall-off match real-time fall-off in Progressive Lightmapper.
    
*   Graphics: Added "base vertex" functionality to `Mesh.SetIndices`, to allow meshes larger than 65k vertices when using 16 bit index buffer..
    
*   Graphics: Added GPU selection in metal for `MacEditor` and `MacStandalonePlayer`.
    
*   Graphics: Added non-allocating overloads for `GeometryUtility.CalculateFrustumPlanes`.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed Occlusion culling regression that was causing objects to be incorrectly culled. (972075)
    
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Instance properties are now packed as arrays of structures. Internally, we changed the constant buffer layout, where multiple instance properties are present. There are three changes in the instancing declaration macros, but the old shaders can be upgraded automatically. For your reference, the three changes are:
    
    1.  UNITY\_INSTANCING\_**CBUFFER**\_START/END renamed to UNITY\_INSTANCING\_**BUFFER**\_START/END.
    2.  UNITY\_INSTANCING\_BUFFER\_END now takes an _arrayName_ in the parentheses.
    3.  UNITY\_ACCESS\_INSTANCED\_PROP must now be provided with the _arrayName_ in the first argument to indicate where this property comes from. Note that if graphics jobs are not enabled, the CPU-side processing of instance property values are optimized and off-loaded to a worker thread to further reduce CPU cost.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Introduced a new feature on most platforms, called "flexible instancing array sizes". This means you no longer need to specify instancing array sizes. Instead, Unity calculates it from the next draw's instance count.
    
    *   This greatly reduces shader compiling time for instancing variants.
    *   If you always take the maximum constant buffer size allowed by the device, then divide by the instance data structure size, you can further reduce instance batch count, especially on OpenGL and Metal.
    *   This introduces moderate performance improvements, especially for Scenes with lots of small batches. particularly useful if you rely on Unity renderloops to automatically batch instances for you.
*   Graphics: Improved documentation for graphics hardware tiers.
    
*   Graphics: Improved motion vectors precision when dynamic batching is disabled.
    
*   Graphics: Introduced various performance and memory consumption optimizations to the Vulkan renderer.
    
*   Graphics: Optimized Point Light real-time shadows for D3D11.
    
*   Graphics: Updated compute shader API: Added `SetMatrix`, `SetMatrixArray` and `SetVectorArray` for `SetComputeXXX` and for command buffer.
    
*   Graphics: Vulkan: Implemented multidisplay support for the Vulkan rendering back-end (Windows/Linux).
    
*   Graphics: \[Metal\] Eliminated Z-fighting artifacts on certain devices.
    
*   iOS: Exposed `PlayerSettings.iOS.disableDepthAndStencilBuffers` in scripting API. ([938696](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/playersettings-dot-ios-dot-disabledepthandstencilbuffers-is-not-implemented-for-ios-platform))
    
*   iOS: \[Metal\] Improved render thread scheduling.
    
*   Kernel: Made optimizations to the job system to reduce CPU usage on job worker threads in specific scenarios.
    
*   Linux: Enabled Wayland support (experimental, requires `-force-wayland` command line argument).
    
*   Linux: Updated to SDL 2.0.5.
    
*   Mobile: Engine code stripping now works on Android.
    
*   OSX: Fixed input configuration behaviour in launcher window, sharing code used elsewhere.
    
*   Package Manager: Added update to allow you to reset Project packages to Editor defaults.
    
*   Particles: Added a **Resimulate** checkbox for previewing all looping Particle Systems in Edit Mode. ![description](/sites/default/files/2017_3_improvement_particle_svo_0.png)
    
*   Particles: Added an option to the Scene View FX dropdown to toggle the visibility of Particle Systems.
    
*   Particles: Added script accessors for `animatedVelocity` and `totalVelocity`/ These allow you to query the total velocity of a particle from script, rather than just the physics velocity.
    
*   Particles: Added support for Meshes using lines and linestrips for particle Shape Module spawning. ([931662](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particles-are-not-spawned-properly-on-triangles-line-if-mesh-consists-of-edges-and-has-no-actual-triangles))
    
*   Particles: Added update to display particle stats in Editor Play Mode for selected systems.
    
*   Particles: Improved the workflow for creating multiple Particle Systems inside a shared GameObject hierarchy: The Particle System no longer resumes playing a paused preview when you select systems belonging to the same effect.
    
*   Particles: Moved **Resimulate** and **Show Bounds** from the Inspector to the Scene View Overlay.
    
*   Physics: Introduced Cloth self-collision and inter-collision tools and technology. Improved constraint painting.
    
*   Profiler: Added experimental option to use Deep Profiler in Players with Mono runtime.
    
*   Scripting: Added a fastpath which avoids boxing of value types when a UnityEvent invokes listeners with the exact same argument types ([932039](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unnecessary-garbage-is-generated-while-invoking-unityevents-due-to-boxing))
    
*   Testing: Introduced \[RequirePlatformSupport\] in the Editor Tests framework, allowing tests to be marked as requiring support for particular platforms to be installed.
    
*   Testing: The `-testCategory` command line argument (to select the category of tests to run) now supports regular expressions.
    
*   Timeline: Added multi-selection capabilities to the Clip Inspector.
    
*   Timeline: Introduced various clip snap improvements:
    
    *   Improved snap precision
    *   Added Multi-selection clip snap support
    *   Added double side snap hint
    *   You can now hold down Ctrl to toggle snapping when moving clips
    *   No snapping on Muted tracks
    *   Auto snapping on Clip Asset duration and loop ends
*   Timeline: Made improvements to the Copy/Paste workflow.
    
*   UI: All Editor tab views now use `FitToContents` for button contents with flexible space on either side of toolbar, instead of filling window width.
    
*   UI: Cached `eventCamera` access in `Raycast()` to avoid calling `Camera.main` multiple times.
    
*   UI: Improved UI for currently selected profiler connection.
    
*   UI: Improved `MarkLayoutAsDirty` by early-exiting check loop, inlining check and removing list manipulation.
    
*   UI: Made performance improvements to GraphicRaycaster and EventSystem. (934842)
    
*   WebGL: Changed `WebGLExceptionSupport.Full` to `WebGLExceptionSupport.FullWithStacktrace` and added `WebGLExceptionSupport.FullWithoutStacktrace`.
    
*   Windows: Added support for proxy setup on UWP.
    
*   XR: Added support for Single-Pass stereo rendering on MacOS.

([733507](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vr-terrain-tree-billboards-position-gets-offsetted-by-vr-headset-position), [946544](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vr-android-terrain-tree-billboards-position-gets-offsetted-by-vr-headset-position))
    
*   XR: Updated Google VR NDK to 1.80.
    
*   XR: Updated Vuforia to version 7.0.36
    
*   XR: XR now supports jittered projection matrices (for use with TAA). (873685)

### Known Issues in 2017.3.0f3

*   Android: Gradle builds fail when there are more than 250 files in streamingAssets. As a workaround, you can use a custom file extension for the files you want uncompressed. Specify this extension in a custom Gradle mainTemplate under "noCompress". You should also remove "**STREAMING\_ASSETS**" from the template to avoid hitting the file limit. (962451)
    
*   Editor: Editor generating many undo steps when dragging a slider (976805)
    
*   Editor: MonoDevelop might get corrupted on macOS. Workaround is to rename MonoDevelop.app to something else like MonoDevelop2.app and then back to MonoDevelop.app again. This will make MonoDevelop work again. (969131)
    
*   Editor: Sometimes, scene gets dirty after pressing play ([966172](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scene-gets-dirtied-after-pressing-play-it-may-be-related-to-layout-groups))
    
*   Editor: Unable to drag assets from Windows Folder to Unity when Editor is started as administrator
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: \[WSA\]Unity throws a `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException` error when exporting to the WSA player (UWP/.NET Backend) with a Project folder that has a long path. ([959984](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/wsa-system-dot-io-dot-directorynotfoundexception-when-exporting-to-wsa-player-uwp-slash-dot-net-backend-with-long-project-folder))
    
*   XR: \[Android\] Unity throws an exception while initializing GoogleVR from the Unity library using the Gradle build system. ([946104](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-exception-while-initializing-googlevr-from-unity-library-using-gradle-build-system-release-build))
    
*   Editor: Unity does not create the Transform hierarchy on an an async-loaded GameObject if it accesses the GameObject before the async load is complete. ([860938](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/running-uril-dot-urilmanager-dot-create-method-in-editor-crashes-unity))
    
*   Editor: Use of "external script editor" in editor preferences doesn't work with some editors. Workaround is to use "open by file extension". (974296)
    
*   Scripting: Instantiating a prefab crashes the Editor if you create a list with type `ResourceRequest` after a while loop. ([908339](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/instantiating-a-prefab-after-creating-a-list-with-type-resourcerequest-after-a-while-loop-crashes-the-editor))
    
*   Substance: Animated Procedural Textures break async level loading. ([959858](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-black-screen-using-procedural-texture))
