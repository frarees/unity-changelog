### Fixes

*   ([814152](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/camera-ignores-rect-if-settargetbuffers-is-used)) - Camera: Fixed an issue where rect was ignored when using SetTargetBuffers.
*   ([816585](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/serial-number-entering-textfield-looses-and-regains-focus-when-character-is-written)) - Editor: Fixed Cef focus issue caused by multiple webview refreshes.
*   ([801677](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crashed-while-importing)) - Graphics: Fixed crashes on very large texture imports.
*   (805892) - IL2CPP/XBoxOne: Prevent the C++ compiler from crashing while compiling the IL2CPPCompilerCalculateTypeValues.cpp file for some projects. This file was just too large in these cases, so IL2CPP will not generate multiple smaller files instead.
*   ([813962](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-building-process-fails-when-two-structs-contain-struct-arrays-of-each-other)) - IL2CPP: Generate C++ code properly now for two structs that contain arrays of each other as fields.
*   ([812570](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-marshaldirectiveexception-marshaling-of-delegates-as-fields-of-a-struct-is-not-working)) - IL2CPP: Properly marshal delegates when they are fields of a struct.
*   ([817335](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-crash-when-running-on-ios-simulator-with-xcode-8-dot-0-beta-3)) - iOS: Fixed iOS 10 simulator crash.
*   ([816514](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-input-dot-mouseposition-resets-to-0-0-0-when-alt-or-home-keys-are-pressed-on-linux-builds)) - Linux Standalone: Fixed an issue where pressing 'Alt' incorrectly reset Input.mousePosition.
*   ([806751](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/transparent-shader-writes-into-depthnormals-texture)) - Shaders: Fixed transparent shader writing into DepthNormals texture, because material sometimes cache RenderType setting.
*   ([714707](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cant-move-a-folder-when-using-perforce-integration)) - VCS: Fixed a problem when moving folders in the project view end up with errors and inconsistent state between local file state and VCS state.
*   ([816582](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/wsa-bluetooth-devices-are-not-supported)) - Windows Store: Gamepads (with UsagePage/Usage 0x0001/0x0005) will correctly connect to an application now. Usually these are device connected via bluetooth. Previously only joysticks (with UsagePage/Usage 0x0001/0x0004) would connect. You can check UsagePage/Usage of the device by right clicking Properties on the device->Hardware->HID-compliant game controller->Properties->Details->Hardware Ids. For ex., gamepads will contain an item "HID\_DEVICE\_UP:0001\_U:0005) . You might need to delete Package.appxmanifest, because there's a new item for HID device.
*   (810622) - Windows Store: When updating Windows Phone 8 application to Windows Phone 8.1/10.0, player prefs will be auto updated if the following condition is met - UnityPlayer.upp file exist, but playerprefs.dat file doesn't exist in LocalFolder.
