### Improvements

*   Android: IL2CPP - Stripping of symbols and debug info is now enabled by default. Development builds still have symbols which makes for a slightly larger binary.
*   Asset management: Added offset argument to AssetBundle.CreateFromFile and AssetBundle.LoadFromFileÂ methods.
*   Hardware Stats updates information that might change during sessions.
*   iOS: Added a compile flag in the trampoline code in order to allow the user to disable the filtering of emoji characters.

### Changes

*   Android: IL2CPP - Full debug version of IL2CPP libraries are stored in Temp/StagingArea/Il2Cpp/Native.
