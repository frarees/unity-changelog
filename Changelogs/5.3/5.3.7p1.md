### Fixes

*   (818174) - Android: Fixed case of audio stutter when launching Android player from a notification on the lockscreen.
*   ([807983](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/807983/)) - Android: Fixed an issue whereby the projects without audio stopping the external audio sources.
*   ([824009](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/824009/)) - Asset Bundles: Fixed the assetBundle property of AssetBundleCreateRequest so that it stalls instead of returning null when the bundle is not yet ready.
*   ([829898](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/829898/)) - Build player: Reverted the change, which saved relative paths for build target but introduced issues for targets that needed to browse for folders instead of files (webGL, etc).
*   ([837783](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/837783/)) - Graphics: Fixed potential lock when in fullscreen exclusive mode and minimising/maximising screen.
*   ([840596](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/840596/)) - IL2CPP: A call to GetCurrentMethod in a generic method should return the generic method definition, not the inflated generic instance method.
*   ([845666](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/845666/)) - IL2CPP: Fixed stacktraces on iOS when Link Time Optimization (LTO) was enabled in the build.
