### Improvements

*   GI: Optimized GISceneManager.Update in order to take less processor time on scene start (769044).
*   Substance: A FreezeAndReleaseSourceData() method was added to the ProceduralMaterial class. This renders the ProceduralMaterial immutable and releases some of the underlying data to decrease the memory footprint. To release even more of the underlying data, it is necessary to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() afterwards. Once frozen, the ProceduralMaterial cannot be cloned, its ProceduralTextures cannot be rebuilt, nor its inputs be set.

### Changes

*   Audio/Scripting: An optimization was reverted while fixing ([739224](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-while-reimporting-audioscriptbuffermanager-dot-cpp)) and (761360) which would cause memory to once again be allocated during audio callbacks.
