### Known Issues

*   OSX has a number of graphical issues in the editor with the new OpenGL core. If --force-opengl resolves them, the next release should likely resolve them.

### Change

*   Physics: Allow the PhysX CharacterController to consider the slope limit for Rigidbodies. This fixes bugs where the CharacterController could climb on very steep slopes on Rigidbodies. Restores Unity4 behavior.

### Improvement

*   Expose the error tolerance on SpringJoint. This allows the springs to have a rest length shorter than the default 2.5 cm.

### Fixes

*   Editor: Fixed issue with unnecessary whitespace being added to generated MonoDevelop/VS solution (.sln) files after each update.
*   Editor: Removed MonoDevelop Solution Properties checkbox from External Tools. Unity no longer writes MonoDevelop code formatting settings into MonoDevelopSolutionProperties in .sln file.
*   GI: Fixed crash when calling SetEmissive for a system with no radiosity data available.
*   Mecanim: Added type check when firing events with Object parameters.
*   Mecanim: Changed error message when animator transitions cannot be previewed
*   Mecanim: Fixed a problem with state machines where Animation events on the first frame wouldn't fire in some cases
*   Mecanim: Fixed Animator.Play not working on 1st frame when enabling GameObject.
*   Mecanim: Fixed blending that was different when swapping OverrideController at runtime.
*   Mecanim: Fixed crash when enabling an Animator on an object that was disabled then re-enabled.
*   Mecanim: Fixed error when adding transition.
*   Mecanim: Fixed Event key in animation window is not movable if keyframe is added.
*   Mecanim: Fixed speed being not applied correctly when manually updating Animator.
*   OpenGL: Fixed editor font rendering, characters disappearing.
*   Physics: Fixed issues where PhysX SphereCasts would return an incorrect collision point for a scaled non-convex MeshCollider

The following are changes and fixes to 5.3 features and regressions...
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Change

*   Disabled the "Resample Rotations" option in humanoid because it had issues.

### Improvement

*   MSE: SceneManager API are now using enums instead of bools for better readability
*   MSE: SceneManager related classes have now been placed in namespaces: UnityEngine.SceneManagement and UnityEditor.SceneManagement

### Fixes

*   GI: Cache final light color in Linear space so we don't need to do GammaToLinearSpace() when calculating Spherical Harmonics on every object. Fixes performance regression.
*   IL2CPP: Prevent a crash in the player in MetadataCache::GetTypeInfoFromTypeDefinitionIndex when a constrained call is made to a generic virtual method defined on a value type.
*   IL2CPP: Prevent a memory leak that caused some GCHandles, including those used to reference MonoBehaviour instances, from being correctly reclaimed by the garbage collector.
*   Mecanim: Fixed a regression where some Light properties could not be animated
