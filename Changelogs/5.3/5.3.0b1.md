*   MSE: Deleting a scene in the ProjectView does not update the Hierarchy View and trying to save the scene again throws exceptions, data will be lost [(725534)](http://fogbugz.unity3d.com/default.asp?725534)
*   MSE: √çf the scene was unloaded but still part of the hierarchy trying to load it will throw exceptions [(725542)](http://fogbugz.unity3d.com/default.asp?725542)

*   Fixed a typo that caused an internal debug pointer to be erroneously included in Standalone players.
*   Fixed Handles.DrawDottedLines not working when intersecting near plane.Fixed Handles.DrawDottedLines not properly scaling dots on retina.Improved Handles.DrawDottedLines performance.
