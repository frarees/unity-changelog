### Improvements

*   (706098) - Compute: Improved compute shader import times, particularly on Windows (since 5.1 we were always compiling them for GL4.3+GLES3.1 too, while most people only need DX11).
*   ([754898](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/negative-ambient-light-artifacts-in-5-dot-3-is-worse-than-prior-versions)) - GI: Light probes and ambient (everything with SH calculations) match ground truth more closely now.
*   IL2CPP: Optimize method prologues for code size and incremental builds.
*   SceneManagement: Add Scene.GetRootGameObjects() to return the root game objects of the scene.
*   SceneManagement: Add SceneManager.CreateScene() API to allow creating new empty scene at runtime
*   tvOS: Enable Dynamic GI

### Changes

*   iOS: Enable bitcode support by default.
