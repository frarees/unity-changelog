*   (none) - Graphics : Fixed loading shaders in a variant collection not loading the variants from all passes which match.
*   ([921083](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/921083/)) - Graphics : Fixed a crash whenÂ depth surface was missing from RenderTarget setup i.e. GrabPass.
*   (none) - IL2CPP : Fixed calling System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2 methods on native objects that implement Windows.Foundation.Collections.IMap`2 interface from managed code and calling Windows.Foundation.Collections.IMap`2 methods on managed objects that implement System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2 interface from native code.
*   ([932981](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/932981/)) - IL2CPP : Fixed calling Windows.Foundation.Collections.PropertySet methods that derive from IDictionary\`2 interface from managed code.
*   ([940906](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/940906/)) - IL2CPP : Added an extra check for a method with a body but an empty instruction list to prevent a crash in IL2CPP.
*   (925709) - Particles : Removed unnecessary sync between main and graphics threads improving performance when more than one camera is rendering
*   (none) - Scripting : Raised MarshalDirectiveException rather than aborting when invalid array marshaling directive was encountered
*   (none) - Scripting : Avoid stack overflow from occurring in Unity liveness logic (asset GC).
*   (none) - Scripting : Fixed Marshal.StructureToPtr when a field type was a multidimensional array of blittable types.
