5.6.0b5 Release Notes (Delta since b4)
--------------------------------------

### System Requirement Changes

*   Android minimum version supported updated to 4.1 (JellyBean).

### Known Issues

*   2D: 2D Sprites cannot be dragged to the Scene view if the project is created in 3D. (863887)
*   2D: Opening sprite editor after importing any package crashes editor (873335)
*   Animation: Problems with Animator in 5.6.0 beta after upgrading project from 5.5.0p3 (864062)
*   Editor: Editor crashes when selecting objects in hierarchy. Can be worked around by deleting Assets/Prefabs/Trees folder. (837840)
*   GI: Compositing process gets stuck while building lighting. (863964)
*   iOS: Rendering orientation is incorrect if orientation is overridden in `Start()` in your projectâ€™s first Scene.
*   Particles: Game crashes occur during Play mode when a Particle System is a sub-emitter of more than one other Particle System. (857065)
*   Particles: Particle System glitch with some Mesh types. (863967)
*   Scripting: An API Updater internal error "Recursion detected while updating scripts (assembly index: 4)" is thrown when updating scripts. Note that this occurs when importing some 5.4 projects directly into 5.6 beta. One workaround is to do an intermediate import/save into 5.5. (863941)
*   VR: \[Daydream\] iOS is not supported with the current native integration, but will be available in an upcoming beta release.
*   VR: \[Daydream\] There is a memory leak when you exit and re-enter VR mode. This leak is on the native Google VR code and Google is actively working on fixing this. (859281)
*   VR: \[Daydream\] There is no native controller integration yet. For controller use, please use the Unity SDK provided by Google.
*   VR: \[Daydream\] You may notice that your Daydream VR display is dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design, as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.

### Features

*   2D: Enabled BoxCollider2D & EdgeCollider2D Edge Radius Feature.
*   Android: Added target API level option to Android Player Settings in the Unity Editor.
*   Particles: Added new Shape Module controls to support non-randomized particle emission.
*   Particles: Redesigned Burst Emission to support 8 bursts, and added burst repeat parameters.

### Improvements

*   Asset Import: Significant performance improvements to DXT1, DXT5, BC4 and BC5 texture compressors, resulting in faster asset imports. Fixed cross platform determinism of DXT1, DXT5, BC4 and BC5 compressed textures. We now get the same compressed texture regardless of the platform they're compressed on.
*   Audio: (As also mentioned under API Changes) `AudioClip` is now always loaded on a separate thread, resulting in improvements to Scene loading time. This is because the rest of the Scene can be loaded while Audio Clips are decompressed. `AudioClip.loadInBackground` is now obsolete and no longer used.
*   Shaders: Added ability to disable shader pass per-material, see Material.SetShaderPassEnabled.

### API Changes

*   Audio: (As also mentioned under Improvements) `AudioClip` is now always loaded on a separate thread, resulting in improvements to Scene loading time. This is because the rest of the Scene can be loaded while Audio Clips are decompressed. `AudioClip.loadInBackground` is now obsolete and no longer used.
*   Editor: `Handles.DrawCapFunction` (and associated `Handles` functions expecting it) is now obsolete, and generates warning messages.
*   Graphics: Added `Matrix4x4.LookAt` function.
*   Scripting: Added new non-allocating accessors to `Mesh`. These accessors write into a user-specified `List`. The new accessors are `GetBindposes`, `GetBoneWeights`, `GetColors`, `GetIndices`, `GetNormals`, `GetTangents`, `GetTriangles`, and `GetVertices` (also being back-ported to 5.5.x).

5.6.0b5 Release Notes (Full)
----------------------------

### Features

*   2D: Enabled BoxCollider2D & EdgeCollider2D Edge Radius Feature.
*   2D: Sorting Group:
    *   Sorts a group of Renderers (for instance, a character made up of a group of Sprite Renderers) as a whole, without any interleaving of other Renderers.
*   2D: Sprite Editor Window now supports Sprite outline editing to control Sprite Mesh generation.
*   2D: SpriteRenderer: Added support for 9-slice Sprite rendering.
*   AI: Low-Level API for NavMesh building:
    *   Create and update NavMesh data at runtime.
    *   Use multiple instances of NavMeshes.
    *   Control the life-time of the NavMesh instances.
    *   Create and manage NavMesh Build Settings for multiple agent sizes.
    *   Additional open-sourced components and examples available at: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents
*   Android: Added target API level option to Android Player Settings in the Unity Editor.
*   Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions.
*   Compute: Added support for Metal Compute (iOS/macOS).
*   Editor: Added TreeView IMGUI Control, which can display hierarchical data that can be expanded and collapsed. Additionally, it allows you to create list views and multi-column tables for Editor tools.
*   Editor: Exposed the following custom handle classes in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls: BoxBoundsHandle, CapsuleBoundsHandle, SphereBoundsHandle.
*   Editor: Interactive handles for editing primitive Collider types in the Scene view now all use the same logic:
    
    *   Drag a handle to expand the size only on that side.
    *   Hold to pin the center in place.
    *   Hold to scale the shape uniformly.
    
    These changes apply to BoxCollider, CapsuleCollider, SphereCollider, BoxCollider2D, CapsuleCollider2D, and CircleCollider2D.
    
*   Facebook: Added "Facebook" as a new Build Target Platform. This allows you to publish your builds to Facebook using either WebGL or the Facebook Gameroom Windows app.
*   GI: Added Light Modes, which replace mixed mode lighting and provide flexible ways to merge baked and realtime shadows. As part of this:
    *   Added ability to bake shadowmasks.
    *   New Lighting window layout.
    *   Added Light Explorer window.
*   Graphics: Added EncodeToEXR to Texture2D.
*   Graphics: Added HDR MSAA anti-aliasing support. HDR rendering and MSAA anti-aliasing now works as expected with forward shading.
*   Graphics: Added physically-based rendering Material validator. You can now validate Albedo and Specular values against acceptable ranges. Albedo values can also be validated against user-defined luminance ranges.
*   Graphics: Support for DrawMeshInstancedIndirect, where draw arguments are supplied from a ComputeBuffer.
*   Graphics: Support for Procedural Instancing, where instance data is supplied via a custom source in the Shader, rather than from Material Property Blocks.
*   Graphics: Vulkan rendering backend added for Android, Linux and Windows. It is not used by default yet; drag it to the top of Graphics API list in Player Settings (menu: Edit > Project Settings > Player) to use it.
*   IL2CPP: Added support for Windows Runtime when targeting Windows Store and Xbox One players with .NET 4.6 API Compatibility Level. See the Unity User Manual documentation on [IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/IL2CPP.html) for more information on Windows Runtime support.
*   Particles: Added new Shape Module controls to support non-randomized particle emission.

*   Physics: Added new CompositeCollider2D component, providing the ability to merge together BoxCollider2D & PolygonCollider2D colliders.
*   Physics: Physics Debug
    *   A tool designed to provide a visualization of what is going on in our physics middleware (PhysX), allowing you to quickly inspect the Collider geometry in your Scene, and profile common physics-based scenarios.
    *   Also serves as a profiling tool, because it can hide all sleeping Rigidbody components and show all concave Mesh Colliders.
*   Player: Added native Daydream integration as a VR target for Unity VR applications.
*   Video: Added Video Player component and Video Clip Importer Asset Importer. They replace Movie Texture and its Importer (available with a legacy control). The workflow audio platform support and scripting API are due to be improved in the next alpha release.
*   VR: Added initial Vulkan support for OpenVR.

### Changes

*   Android: Buildpipe - Removed AnyCPU option from .so files in Plugin inspector.
*   Android: Minimum supported Android API incremented from 9 (gingerbread) to 16 (jellybean).
*   Editor: Building in linear color space is no longer allowed for platforms that don't support it.
*   Graphics: Refactored camera render ordering code. When a scene is rendered it now figures out which cameras can share the same render target. The rules for this are:
    *   Same display.
    *   Are we in VR (implicit shared target).
    *   They share the same viewport.
    *   They all have or do not have a depth buffer. These cameras are then split into a 'stack' that is rendered based on depth ordering into a shared texture. The texture will have the most 'common' settings from the cameras in the stack:
    *   If any camera wants MSAA it will be an MSAA buffer.
    *   If any camera wants HDR it will be a HDR buffer.
    *   If there are any deferred cameras in the stack MSAA will be disabled (MSAA is not compatible).
*   Graphics: Removed MSAA from back buffer on MOST devices / platforms. Much like HDR, MSAA generally now requires a render texture. This is implicitly supported via the render stack mechanism. If you require MSAA the target that will be rendered to will have MSAA enabled (so long as deferred is not used in the stack). On iOS and Android we still allow MSAA BB as these platforms have a large number of no image effects games and we want to avoid the extra blit.
*   Linux / SteamOS: Switched window management and input handling from X11 to SDL2 on Linux / SteamOS.
*   Scripting: Script serialization errors that were introduced in Unity 5.4 but did not always throw a managed exception, now always do so in Unity 5.6.
*   Scripting: The behaviour for ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize has changed when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab. Previously the callback was invoked twice: once before the object was fully deserialized (internal references not yet updated) and once after the object was fully deserialized (internal references are updated). In Unity 5.6 and above, SerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize is only invoked once, after the object is fully deserialized, when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab.
    
*   Shaders: Removed glstate\_matrix\_mvp, glstate\_matrix\_modelview0, glstate\_matrix\_transpose\_modelview0 and glstate\_matrix\_invtrans\_modelview0:
    
    *   In order to use these matrices, use UNITY\_MATRIX\_MVP and friends instead (as you should be doing already).
    *   But note! For better performance, always prefer UnityObjectToClipPos and UnityObjectToViewPos if you are transforming vertices into clip space and view space respectively. Warning messages are printed on detection of uses of UNITY\_MATRIX\_MVP and UNITY\_MATRIX\_MV.
    *   Since now we have unified the transforming path, #pragma force\_concat\_matrices is obsolete.
    *   Our tests show an improvement in CPU performance and a degradation in GPU performance. The difference, however, is only noticeable when vertex load is very high.
*   Shaders: Shader compilation now stops on the first error.
*   Windows Store: D3D is now the default build type when building for Universal 10 SDK.

### Improvements

*   2D: Axis Distance Sort:
    *   Added CustomAxis to TransparencySortMode of Camera to allow users to sort renderers against a preferred axis instead of just by depth from the camera.
*   2D: Refactored the internal storage of Sprite data to a more flexible storage structure. This is the precursor to new 2D features coming down the pipelne. Note that textures will therefore be re-imported on opening an existing project in Unity 5.6 for the first time.
*   Android: Added support for managed stack traces on Android with IL2CPP.
*   Android: Moved Android splash image to a Java implementation so that it is displayed quicker during engine loading.
*   Animation: Added a 3rd spine bone, UpperChest, to humanoid rig.
*   Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions
*   Animation: Disabled auto-framing of AnimatorController when selecting states or transitions
*   Animation: Performance improvements for selection and keyframe manipulation in Curve Editor.
*   Asset Import: Significant performance improvements to DXT1, DXT5, BC4 and BC5 texture compressors, resulting in faster asset imports. Fixed cross platform determinism of DXT1, DXT5, BC4 and BC5 compressed textures. We now get the same compressed texture regardless of the platform they're compressed on.
*   Audio: (As also mentioned under API Changes) `AudioClip` is now always loaded on a separate thread, resulting in improvements to Scene loading time. This is because the rest of the Scene can be loaded while Audio Clips are decompressed. `AudioClip.loadInBackground` is now obsolete and no longer used.
*   Compute: Added ability to setup & dispatch compute shaders from CommandBuffers. See new CommandBuffer functions: SetCompute\*Param, DispatchCompute, CopyCounterValue.
*   Compute: ComputeShader inspector lists kernels, and compiled code shows disassembly on DX11. UNITY\_VERSION macro is passed while compiling compute shaders, just like for regular shaders.
*   DX12: Reduced system and video memory usage.
*   Editor: Added interface support to Selection.GetFiltered.
*   Editor: Editor's game view window will fully support touches on Windows when touch screen is available (for ex., Surface Pro). Functions like Input.GetTouch should therefore start working.
*   Editor: Graphics device arguments now persist when relaunching editor.
*   Editor: Window layouts are now serialized as text.
*   GI: Added rgb9e5 float texture format for precomputed realtime GI on all supported platforms. This format can be interpolated without artifacts. Unsupported platforms will fall back to RGBM encoding and can still have banding from interpolation.
*   GI: Added to ReflectionProbe: defaultTexture, defaultTextureHDRDecodeValues, textureHDRDecodeValues.
*   GI: Enlighten SDK upgraded to version 3.07p1. This should provide precompute time reductions, which will be especially noticeable in the CalculateSystemDependencies step as well as other steps which perform ray-tracing. Additional details:
    *   An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in wrong lighting when using transparent materials.
    *   An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in it ignoring the 'backface behaviour type' material property.
    *   Fixed issue that prevented baked light masks working in conjunction with transparency textures.
    *   Fixed a bug resulting in wrong lighting for SSD objects when using probes with non-default axes or SH coefficient orders.
    *   When baking direct probe lighting, the per-light option to disable direct lighting is no longer ignored.
*   GI: Updated default shadow near plane offset.
*   GI: usesRevertedZBuffer is now exposed to SystemInfo.
*   Graphics: "-gpu" command line argument is now supported in the Windows Store player
*   Graphics: Added CommandBuffer functions: SetViewport, SetViewMatrix, SetProjectionMatrix, SetViewProjectionMatrices.
*   Graphics: Added cube array texture support to OSX Metal.
*   Graphics: Added RenderQueue.GeometryLast enum value.
*   Graphics: Added SystemInfo.graphicsUVStartsAtTop property.
*   Graphics: CommandBuffer API improvements:
    *   More CommandBuffer APIs: CopyTexture, EnableShaderKeyword, DisableShaderKeyword.
    *   CommandBuffer.GetTemporaryRT got an enableRandomWrite argument.
*   Graphics: Frame Debugger improvements:
    *   Ctrl+Click on texture properties pops up a larger preview, just like the Standard shader UI does. This is also useful for viewing cubemap textures.
    *   ComputeShader dispatches now shows the compute shader, kernel and dispatch size used.
    *   The Shader properties tab is now the default one (instead of mesh preview).
    *   The Shader properties view now shows the ComputeBuffer properties that are used.
*   Graphics: Frame Debugger now shows the reason why a draw call can't be batched with the previous one.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: a new workflow is implemented. In short, you can now simply check the "Enable Instancing" checkbox on most of the Materials, including those using Standard shaders.
    *   A "#pragma multi\_compile\_instancing" line now is no longer needed in surface shaders. Instancing variants are automatically generated for surface shaders, unless you explicitly specify "noinstancing" in a "#pragma surface" line.
    *   Standard and StandardSpecular also have "#pragma multi\_compile\_instancing" built-in.
    *   A new checkbox "Enable Instancing" is added to the Material inspector and it must be checked if you want objects rendered with this material to be instanced.
    *   SpeedTree assets now prints an error prompting you to regenerate the materials on enabling this checkbox.
    *   Please note that all existing projects that utilize instancing need to enable this checkbox if the material is intended to be used for instancing, including those for DrawMeshInstanced.
    *   When building to players, instancing variants of a shader are stripped away if no material using this shader enables instancing. You can have a global stripping control in Graphics settings.
*   Graphics: HDR rendering supports R11G11B10 float formats in addition to FP16. This can be configured in Graphics Settings per platform & tier.
*   IL2CPP: Generated C++ code will now contain annotations of original C# source code, as long as PDB/MDB files accompanying the C# source code are present on the machine at conversion time.
*   OSX: Added support for retrieving GPU memory size on Metal.
*   Particles: Custom Data can now be configured via the Inspector using a new Module, instead of exclusively via Script.
*   Particles: Full support for multiple selection and editing of Particle Systems.
*   Particles: Gradient Editor now supports HDR colors when used in the Custom Data streams.
*   Particles: Huge performance improvement for particle collision against 2D Colliders.
*   Particles: Improved overlap solver for particle collision against 2D Colliders.
*   Particles: The UI for Custom Vertex Streams has been redesigned to allow greater flexibility over what data to send to the shader, and to add more control over how it is packed into the TEXCOORD channels.
*   Physics: 2D contacts are now shown in the Inspector 'Info' rollout for Collider2D and Rigidbody2D.
*   Physics: Added a non-allocating way to retrieve contacts per Collider2D or Rigidbody2D using `Physics2D.GetContacts ()`, `Collider2D.GetContacts ()` & `Rigidbody2D.GetContacts ()`.
*   Physics: Complete rewrite of internal 2D contact processing providing a more robust and reliable reporting of contacts.
*   Physics: New ContactFilter2D, allowing physics queries to filter by layer mask, Z depth, normal angle and trigger inclusion.
*   Physics: Provision of non-allocating overloads that use the new ContactFilter2D for Linecast, Raycast, BoxCast, CircleCast, CapsuleCast, OverlapPoint, OverlapCircle, OverlapBox, OverlapArea, OverlapCapsule, GetContacts & IsTouching.
*   Profiling: Added Profiling.Recorder API providing the ability to get accumulated frame time for the specific Profiler label in the Editor and Developments Players
*   Shaders: Added ability to disable shader pass per-material, see Material.SetShaderPassEnabled.
*   Shaders: HLSLPROGRAM shader snippet support. Same as CGPROGRAM, with one difference: HLSLSupport.cginc and UnityShaderVariables.cginc includes are not added automatically.
*   Shaders: Optimized in-editor experience for shaders with potentially massive variant counts (order of "millions"). Importing and first-time compiling them is much faster now.
*   Shaders: Preprocessor macros SHADER\_STAGE\_VERTEX, SHADER\_STAGE\_FRAGMENT, SHADER\_STAGE\_DOMAIN, SHADER\_STAGE\_HULL, SHADER\_STAGE\_GEOMETRY, SHADER\_STAGE\_COMPUTE are defined when compiling each shader stage.
*   Shaders: The .hlsl file extension is now recognized in the same way as .cginc one (included into generated IDE projects, opened same way from the editor).
*   Terrain: A warning box will be shown if you try to assign a texture that is not imported as a normal map to the normal map slot of the terrain material.
*   Terrain: Terrain Inspector now remembers the last selected brush shape.
*   Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster (specifically, TerrainData.SetHeights and setting the size property are faster now).
*   VR: Added single-pass stereo support for Gear VR (using GL\_OVR\_multiview).
*   VR: Attached VR/AR devices will now add their remote resolution to the Game View sizes dropdown in the Editor.
*   Web: In UnityWebRequest, response code and headers are now available to scripts as soon as they are downloaded. Previously they were accesible only after the whole download was complete.
*   Windows Store: C++ source code plugins can now be included directly from the generated Visual Studio solution. This is possible by adding the directory containing the source code to the list of include directories, and linking the DLL they get compiled in to the final game executable on the il2cpp scripting backend.
*   Windows Store: Significantly reduced the size of Windows Store support installers.
*   Windows Store: Significantly reduced the time the postprocessing player step takes when building project on the IL2CPP scripting backend.
*   Windows Store: Unity now uses prebuilt MapFileParser when building generated C++ code on the IL2CPP scripting backend, rather than building it on your machine on the fly.

### API Changes

*   Animation: Added to `AvatarMask`: `AddTransformPath`, `RemoveTransformPath`.
*   Animation: Added `AnimatorOverrideController.GetOverrides` and `AnimatorOverrideController.ApplyOverrides`. (752095)
*   Animation: Deprecated `AnimatorOverrideController.clips`. (752095)
*   Animation: Moved `AvatarMask` from `UnityEditor.Animations` to `UnityEngine`.
*   Asset Pipeline: Added new API methods `AssetDatabase.GetImplicitAssetBundleName` and `AssetDatabase.GetImplicitAssetBundleVariantName`, which dynamically compute the name of the AssetBundle and AssetBundle Variant that a given Asset belongs to.(834008)
*   Audio: (As also mentioned under Improvements) `AudioClip` is now always loaded on a separate thread, resulting in improvements to Scene loading time. This is because the rest of the Scene can be loaded while Audio Clips are decompressed. `AudioClip.loadInBackground` is now obsolete and no longer used.
*   Editor: (As also mentioned under Features) Exposed the following custom handle classes in `UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls`: `BoxBoundsHandle`, `CapsuleBoundsHandle`, `SphereBoundsHandle`.
*   Editor: Added IDisposable 'Handles.DrawingScope' struct for cleaner pushing/popping of 'Handles.matrix' and 'Handles.color'.
*   Editor: `Handles.DrawCapFunction` (and associated `Handles` functions expecting it) is now obsolete, and generates warning messages.
*   GI: Exposed baked Ambient Occlusion (AO), 'indirectAO' and 'directAO' to scripting API.
*   Graphics: Added array property getters (e.g. `GetFloatArray`) for `Material`, `MaterialPropertyBlock` and `Shader` classes.
*   Graphics: Added integer ('Shader.PropertyToID') overloads to 'Material.SetTextureScale' & 'SetTextureOffset'. (766076)
*   Graphics: Added property getters (e.g. `GetGlobalFloat`) for `Shader` class.
*   Graphics: Added to `CommandBuffer`: `SetGlobalDepthBias`, `BeginSample`, `EndSample` functions.
*   Graphics: Added `Graphics.ConvertTexture` function, for copying between Textures of different sizes/formats.
*   Graphics: Added `Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect` and its `CommandBuffer` counterpart.
*   Graphics: Added `List` overloads for array property setters for `Material`, `MaterialPropertyBlock`, `Shader` and `CommandBuffer` classes.

*   Physics: Exposed `Physics.ClosestPoint`. This computes the point on the surface of a given Collider that is closest to a specified location.
*   Physics: Exposed `Physics.ComputePenetration`. This computes the minimal translation required to separate the two given Colliders. It doesn't require the Colliders to be placed at the given pose prior to the test, so it is useful for writing custom character controllers.
*   SceneManager: `EditorSceneManager` now has a number of new events that developers can add delegates to. They are: `newSceneCreated`, `sceneOpening`, `sceneOpened`, `sceneClosing`, `sceneClosed`, `sceneSaving` and `sceneSaved`.
*   Scripting: Added new non-allocating accessors to `Mesh`. These accessors write into a user-specified `List`. The new accessors are `GetBindposes`, `GetBoneWeights`, `GetColors`, `GetIndices`, `GetNormals`, `GetTangents`, `GetTriangles`, and `GetVertices` (also being back-ported to 5.5.x).
*   Terrain: Added `TerrainChangedFlags` for use in 'OnTerrainChanged' message.
*   Terrain: Added `TerrainData.bounds` for retrieving local bounding box of the Terrain heightmap data.
