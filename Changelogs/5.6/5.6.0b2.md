5.6.0b2 Release Notes (Delta since b1)
--------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   Animation: Crash when previewing clip in AW. (851483)
*   Animation: Selecting a curve preset in the Importer generates error (854799)
*   Asset Pipeline: Referencing UnityEditor.iOS.Extensions.Xcode throws exception after reimporting assets. (778581)
*   Editor: Handles in the scene view are incorrectly offset by 2 points (856685)
*   GI: On new projects, graphic settings are not initialized correctly, so realtime GI and shadows are missing. Workaround is to save and re-start Unity. (858159)
*   iOS: Rendering orientation is incorrect if orientation is overridden in Start() in your projectâ€™s first scene.
*   Particles: Crash when a particle system is sub-emitter of more than one other particle system. (857065)
*   VR: \[Daydream\] Deadlock issue when quitting an app, where the app may still execute for up to 3s after it goes away. (861469)
*   VR: \[Daydream\] iOS is not supported with the current native integration but will be available in an upcoming beta release.
*   VR: \[Daydream\] The unity define that is used to mark Daydream support is incorrectly defined as UNITY\_DAYDREAM instead of UNITY\_HAS\_GOOGLEVR. (861741)
*   VR: \[Daydream\] There is a tiling bug in the Pixel Snapdragon GPU driver that appears when post-processing effects are used. Unlike 5.4, 5.6 currently runs post processing image effects all the time, so the tiling issue will be more noticeable. This will be fixed in a future driver update that Google will ship as an OTA update for affected devices.
*   VR: \[Daydream\] There is no native controller integration yet. For controller use please use the Unity SDK provided by Google.
*   VR: \[Daydream\] You may notice that your Daydream VR display may be dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.

### Features

*   Editor: (As also mentioned under API Changes) Exposed the following custom handle classes in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls: BoxBoundsHandle, CapsuleBoundsHandle, SphereBoundsHandle.
*   Editor: Interactive handles for editing primitive collider types in the scene view now all use the same logic:
    
    *   Dragging a handle expands the size only on that side.
    *   Holding pins the center in place.
    *   Holding scales the shape uniformly.
    
    These changes apply to BoxCollider, CapsuleCollider, SphereCollider, BoxCollider2D, CapsuleCollider2D, and CircleCollider2D
    
*   Editor: TreeView IMGUI Control, which can display hierarchical data that can be expanded and collapsed. Additionally it lets you create list views and multi-column tables for Editor tools.
*   GI: Added Light modes, which replace mixed mode lighting and provide flexible ways to merge baked and realtime shadows. As part of this:
    
    *   Added ability to bake shadowmasks.
    *   New Lighting window layout.
    *   Added Light Explorer window.
    
    Please see the 5.6 upgrade guide for details.
    

### Improvements

*   GI: Enlighten SDK upgraded to version 3.07p1. This should provide precompute time reductions, which will be especially noticeable in the CalculateSystemDependencies step as well as other steps which perform ray-tracing. Additional details:
    *   An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in wrong lighting when using transparent materials.
    *   An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in it ignoring the 'backface behaviour type' material property.
    *   Fixed issue that prevented baked light masks working in conjunction with transparency textures.
    *   Fixed a bug resulting in wrong lighting for SSD objects when using probes with non-default axes or SH coefficient orders.
    *   When baking direct probe lighting, the per-light option to disable direct lighting is no longer ignored.
*   Graphics: Added cube array texture support to OSX Metal.
*   Particles: Full support for multiple selection and editing of Particle Systems.
*   VR: Added single-pass stereo support for Gear VR (using GL\_OVR\_multiview).

5.6.0b2 Release Notes (Full)
----------------------------

### Features

    *   Sorts a group of renderers (for instance, a character made up of a bunch of sprite renderers) as a whole without any interleaving of other renderers.
*   2D: Sprite Editor Window now supports Sprite outline editing to control Sprite mesh generation.
*   AI: Low-Level API for NavMesh building:
    *   Create and update NavMesh data at runtime.
    *   Use multiple instances of NavMeshes.
    *   Control the life-time of the NavMesh instances.
    *   Create and manage NavMesh build settings for multiple agent sizes.
    *   Additional open-sourced components and examples available at: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents
*   Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions
*   Compute: Added support for Metal Compute (iOS/macOS).
*   Editor: (As also mentioned under API Changes) Exposed the following custom handle classes in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls: BoxBoundsHandle, CapsuleBoundsHandle, SphereBoundsHandle.
*   Editor: Interactive handles for editing primitive collider types in the scene view now all use the same logic:
    
    *   Dragging a handle expands the size only on that side.
    *   Holding pins the center in place.
    *   Holding scales the shape uniformly.
    
    These changes apply to BoxCollider, CapsuleCollider, SphereCollider, BoxCollider2D, CapsuleCollider2D, and CircleCollider2D
    
*   Editor: TreeView IMGUI Control, which can display hierarchical data that can be expanded and collapsed. Additionally it lets you create list views and multi-column tables for Editor tools.
*   Facebook: Added "Facebook" as a new Build target. This lets you publish you builds to Facebook using either WebGL or the Facebook Gameroom Windows app.
*   GI: Added Light modes, which replace mixed mode lighting and provide flexible ways to merge baked and realtime shadows. As part of this:
    
    *   Added ability to bake shadowmasks.
    *   New Lighting window layout.
    *   Added Light Explorer window.
    
    Please see the 5.6 upgrade guide for details.
    
*   Graphics: Added EncodeToEXR to Texture2D.
*   Graphics: Added physically based rendering material validator. Albedo and Specular values can be validated against acceptable ranges. Albedo values can also be validated against user defined luminance ranges.
*   Graphics: HDR MSAA anti-aliasing support. Using HDR rendering and MSAA anti-aliasing with forward shading now works as expected!
*   Graphics: Support for DrawMeshInstancedIndirect, where draw arguments are supplied from a ComputeBuffer.
*   Graphics: Support for Procedural Instancing, where instance data is supplied via a custom source in the shader, rather than from Constant Buffers.
*   Graphics: Vulkan rendering backend added for Android, Linux and Windows. It is not used by default just yet; drag to the top of graphics API list in Player Settings to use it.
*   Physics: Added new CompositeCollider2D component providing the ability to merge together BoxCollider2D & PolygonCollider2D colliders.
*   Physics: Physics Debug Visualization.
    *   Designed to provide a "ground truth" for what is going on in our physics middleware and to quickly find the corresponding Colliders in the Unity scene.
    *   Also serves as a profiling tool as it can hide all sleeping Rigidbodies as well as show all concave MeshColliders.
*   Player: Native Daydream integration as a VR target for Unity VR applications.
*   Video: VideoPlayer component and VideoClipImporter asset importer. They replace MovieTexture and its importer (available with a legacy control). The workflow audio platform support and scripting API will get improvements in the next alphas

### Changes

*   Android: Buildpipe - Removed AnyCPU option from .so files in Plugin inspector.
*   Editor: Building in linear color space is no longer allowed for platforms that don't support it.
*   Graphics: Refactored camera render ordering code. When a scene is rendered it now figures out which cameras can share the same render target. The rules for this are:
    *   Same display.
    *   Are we in VR (implicit shared target).
    *   They share the same viewport.
    *   They all have or do not have a depth buffer.  
        These cameras are then split into a 'stack' that is rendered based on depth ordering into a shared texture. The texture will have the most 'common' settings from the cameras in the stack:
    *   If any camera wants MSAA it will be an MSAA buffer.
    *   If any camera wants HDR it will be a HDR buffer.
    *   If there are any deferred cameras in the stack MSAA will be disabled (MSAA is not compatible).
*   Graphics: Removed MSAA from back buffer on MOST devices / platforms. Much like HDR, MSAA generally now requires a render texture. This is implicitly supported via the render stack mechanism. If you require MSAA the target that will be rendered to will have MSAA enabled (so long as deferred is not used in the stack). On iOS and Android we still allow MSAA BB as these platforms have a large number of no image effects games and we want to avoid the extra blit.
*   Linux / SteamOS: Switched window management and input handling from X11 to SDL2 on Linux / SteamOS.
*   Scripting: Script serialization errors that were introduced in Unity 5.4 but did not always throw a managed exception, now always do so in Unity 5.6.
*   Scripting: The behaviour for ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize has changed when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab. Previously the callback was invoked twice: once before the object was fully deserialized (internal references not yet updated) and once after the object was fully deserialized (internal references are updated). In Unity 5.6 and above, SerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize is only invoked once, after the object is fully deserialized, when using Instantiate and UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.CreatePrefab.
    
*   Shaders: Shader compilation now stops on the first error.
    
*   Windows Store: D3D is now the default build type when building for Universal 10 SDK.

### Improvements

*   2D: Axis Distance Sort:
    *   Added CustomAxis to TransparencySortMode of Camera to allow users to sort renderers against a preferred axis instead of just by depth from the camera.
*   2D: Refactored the internal storage of Sprite data to a more flexible storage structure. This is the precursor to new 2D features coming down the pipelne. Note that textures will therefore be re-imported on opening an existing project in Unity 5.6 for the first time.
*   Android: Added support for managed stack traces on Android with IL2CPP.
*   Animation: Added a 3rd spine bone, UpperChest, to humanoid rig.
*   Animation: Added tracking of Animator State Machine view positions
*   Animation: Disabled auto-framing of AnimatorController when selecting states or transitions
*   Animation: Performance improvements for selection and keyframe manipulation in Curve Editor.
*   Compute: Added ability to setup & dispatch compute shaders from CommandBuffers. See new CommandBuffer functions: SetCompute\*Param, DispatchCompute, CopyCounterValue.
*   Compute: ComputeShader inspector lists kernels, and compiled code shows disassembly on DX11. UNITY\_VERSION macro is passed while compiling compute shaders, just like for regular shaders.
*   DX12: Reduced system and video memory usage.
*   Editor: Added interface support to Selection.GetFiltered.
*   Editor: Editor's game view window will fully support touches on Windows when touch screen is available (for ex., Surface Pro). Functions like Input.GetTouch should therefore start working.
*   Editor: Graphics device arguments now persist when relaunching editor.
*   Editor: Window layouts are now serialized as text.
*   GI: Added rgb9e5 float texture format for precomputed realtime GI on all supported platforms. This format can be interpolated without artifacts. Unsupported platforms will fall back to RGBM encoding and can still have banding from interpolation.
*   GI: Added to ReflectionProbe: defaultTexture, defaultTextureHDRDecodeValues, textureHDRDecodeValues.
*   GI: Enlighten SDK upgraded to version 3.07p1. This should provide precompute time reductions, which will be especially noticeable in the CalculateSystemDependencies step as well as other steps which perform ray-tracing. Additional details:
    *   An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in wrong lighting when using transparent materials.
    *   An issue has been fixed in baking when using Final Gather which would result in it ignoring the 'backface behaviour type' material property.
    *   Fixed issue that prevented baked light masks working in conjunction with transparency textures.
    *   Fixed a bug resulting in wrong lighting for SSD objects when using probes with non-default axes or SH coefficient orders.
    *   When baking direct probe lighting, the per-light option to disable direct lighting is no longer ignored.

*   Graphics: Added CommandBuffer functions: SetViewport, SetViewMatrix, SetProjectionMatrix, SetViewProjectionMatrices.
*   Graphics: Added cube array texture support to OSX Metal.
*   Graphics: Added RenderQueue.GeometryLast enum value.
*   Graphics: Added SystemInfo.graphicsUVStartsAtTop property.
*   Graphics: CommandBuffer API improvements:
    *   More CommandBuffer APIs: CopyTexture, EnableShaderKeyword, DisableShaderKeyword.
    *   CommandBuffer.GetTemporaryRT got an enableRandomWrite argument.
*   Graphics: HDR rendering supports R11G11B10 float formats in addition to FP16. This can be configured in Graphics Settings per platform & tier.
*   IL2CPP: Generated C++ code will now contain annotations of original C# source code, as long as PDB/MDB files accompanying the C# source code are present on the machine at conversion time.
*   Particles: Custom Data can now be configured via the Inspector using a new Module, instead of exclusively via Script.
*   Particles: Full support for multiple selection and editing of Particle Systems.
*   Particles: Gradient Editor now supports HDR colors when used in the Custom Data streams.
*   Particles: Huge performance improvement for particle collision against 2D Colliders.
*   Particles: Improved overlap solver for particle collision against 2D Colliders.
*   Particles: The UI for Custom Vertex Streams has been redesigned to allow greater flexibility over what data to send to the shader, and to add more control over how it is packed into the TEXCOORD channels.
*   Physics: 2D contacts are now shown in the Inspector 'Info' rollout for Collider2D and Rigidbody2D.
*   Physics: Added a non-allocating way to retrieve contacts per Collider2D or Rigidbody2D using `Physics2D.GetContacts ()`, `Collider2D.GetContacts ()` & `Rigidbody2D.GetContacts ()`.
*   Physics: Complete rewrite of internal 2D contact processing providing a more robust and reliable reporting of contacts.
*   Physics: New ContactFilter2D, allowing physics queries to filter by layer mask, Z depth, normal angle and trigger inclusion.
*   Physics: Provision of non-allocating overloads that use the new ContactFilter2D for Linecast, Raycast, BoxCast, CircleCast, CapsuleCast, OverlapPoint, OverlapCircle, OverlapBox, OverlapArea, OverlapCapsule, GetContacts & IsTouching.
*   Profiling: Added Profiling.Recorder API providing the ability to get accumulated frame time for the specific Profiler label in the Editor and Developments Players
*   Shaders: HLSLPROGRAM shader snippet support. Same as CGPROGRAM, with one difference: HLSLSupport.cginc and UnityShaderVariables.cginc includes are not added automatically.
*   Shaders: Preprocessor macros SHADER\_STAGE\_VERTEX, SHADER\_STAGE\_FRAGMENT, SHADER\_STAGE\_DOMAIN, SHADER\_STAGE\_HULL, SHADER\_STAGE\_GEOMETRY, SHADER\_STAGE\_COMPUTE are defined when compiling each shader stage.
*   Shaders: The .hlsl file extension is now recognized in the same way as .cginc one (included into generated IDE projects, opened same way from the editor).
*   Terrain: Terrain Inspector now remembers the last selected brush shape.
*   Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster (specifically, TerrainData.SetHeights and setting the size property are faster now).
*   VR: Added single-pass stereo support for Gear VR (using GL\_OVR\_multiview).
*   VR: Attached VR/AR devices will now add their remote resolution to the Game View sizes dropdown in the Editor.
*   Web: In UnityWebRequest, response code and headers are now available to scripts as soon as they are downloaded. Previously they were accesible only after the whole download was complete.
*   Windows Store: Significantly reduced the size of Windows Store support installers.

### API Changes

*   Physics: Exposed Physics.ClosestPoint. Computes the point on the surface of a given Collider that is closest to a specified location.
*   Physics: Exposed Physics.ComputePenetration. Computes the minimal translation required to separate the two given Colliders. Doesn't require the Colliders to be placed at the given pose prior to the test, so is useful for writing custom character controllers.
*   Terrain: Added TerrainChangedFlags for use in OnTerrainChanged message.
*   Terrain: Added TerrainData.bounds for retrieving local bounding box of the terrain heightmap data.
