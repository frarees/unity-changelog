### Preview of Final 2023.3.0a11 Release Notes

#### Features

- Editor: Introduced `IRenderPipelineResources` to host SRP resources, which uses the `ResourcePath` to auto-load resources.

- Graphics: Adding a new per batch layer filtering setting for BatchRendererGroup. This setting is useful for the context of culling out specific batches that go through the batch renderer group.

- Graphics: Updated the default `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings` Inspector to trigger notifications when a value is modified.

- Graphics: We have added a new backend rendering path for rigid GameObjects within Unity that puts them through the Batch Render Group API when the option is enabled on the Render Pipeline asset \('GPU Resident Drawer'\). This functionality will create a persistent GPU state for these objects and they will be rendered by the same fast batching path as used by the entities renderer.

- HDRP: Added path tracing support for the Rendering Debugger &gt; Lighting &gt; Material Overrides.

- Package Manager: Improved Project manifest files to repopulate with default dependencies when the files are empty or full of whitespace.

- Particles: Add BakeTexture and BakeTrailsTexture scripting methods.

- Particles: Added the Custom Vertex Streams feature for particle trails.

- Shadergraph: Added a customizable Heatmap color mode, which by default displays the estimated performance impact of each node in a Shader Graph.

- Shadergraph: Added a new sample content pack that can be installed via the Package Manager.  The samples contain descriptions, examples, and break-downs for a majority of the nodes in Shader Graph - helping users understand the inner workings of the nodes and see examples of how they work and how they can be used.

- Shadergraph: Added a zoom step size option in the user preferences.

- Shadergraph: Added dozens of new shortcuts for adding new nodes, toggling sub-window visibility, and moved several existing shortcuts to the shortcut manager.

- UI Toolkit: Added missing UxmlAttribute converters to support UXML authoring: Gradient, AnimationCurve, ToggleButtonGroupState, Unsigned Int and Unsigned Long.

- UI Toolkit: Added support in PropertyField for ToggleButtonGroupState serialized properties.

- Universal RP: Added a Camera History Texture manager and basic interfaces for accessing per camera history textures.<br>
    History textures are wrapped and stored in types which contain all the textures, additional data and API methods specific for that history.<br>
    History textures are useful for rendering algorithms that accumulate samples over multiple frames or use data of previous frames as input.

- Universal RP: Added support for foveated rendering in the Forward+ rendering path.

- Universal RP: Added the `8192x8192` option in Shadow textures.

- URP: Added APV Lighting Scenario Blending to URP

- WebGL: Implemented the following LocationService methods and properties:<br>
    * `Start()`<br>
    * `Stop()`<br>
    * `isEnabledByUser`<br>
    * `lastData`<br>
    * `status`

#### API Changes

- Accessibility: Added: Added mobile screen reader support for sliders, allowing them to be made compatible with TalkBack \(Android\) and VoiceOver \(iOS\).

- Core: Added: ContextContainer to SRP Core. A storage container which works like a dictionary with the key being a generic type id and the value being the value of the given type.

- Editor: Added: Exposed new MenuItem attribute constructor with a path to iconResource.

- Editor: Added: Layout field in the DropdownMenuDescriptor to the behavior of the menu when there is a large number of items.

- Editor: Added: `EditorGraphicsSettings.TryGetRenderPipelineSettingsForPipeline` to access settings of other pipelines than the currently active pipeline.

- Editor: Added: `HandleUtility.GetOverlappingObjects` for getting an ordered list of all pickable objects under the give mouse location.

- Editor: Added: `HandleUtility.RegisterRenderPickingCallback` and a few peripheral structures that enables custom rendering-based picking solutions to be developed.

- Editor: Deprecated: The property ChildCount on HierarchyNodeFlattened was renamed to ChildrenCount.<br>
    The following methods are now deprecated: GetExpanded replaced by DoesNotHaveFlags\(Collapsed\), GetSelected replaced by HasFlags\(Selected\), SetExpanded replaced by ClearFlags\(Collapsed\), and SetSelected replaced by SetFlags\(Selected\).

- Editor: Deprecated: `ObjectIdResult.DecodeIdFromColor`. Users are now encouraged to use `HandleUtility.DecodeSelectionId` for decoding and `HandleUtility.EncodeSelectionId` for encoding selection IDs.

- Editor: Obsoleted: Made PropertyCollectionAttribute obsolete. Use PropertAttribute constructor argument applyToCollection to make a collection attribute.

- Editor: Obsoleted: Using Unsupported.CaptureScreenshotImmediate will now result in a compilation error. Please use ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot instead.

- GI: Added: Add functions for better manipulating LightTransport.BufferSlice, including LightTransport.BufferID.Slice, LightTransport.BufferSlice.SafeReinterpret and LightTransport.BufferSlice.UnsafeReinterpret.

- GI: Added: New light probe baking API. A data driven, stateless, public API for GI probe baking without dependencies on game objects. The API provides CPU and GPU integrators for direct and indirect radiance, validity and a post processing API for conversion to irradiance and other operations needed to composite results before rendering.

- GI: Changed: Added IDisposable to LightTransport.IProbeIntegrator, LightTransport.IWorld and LightTransport.PostProcessing.IProbePostProcessor interfaces.

- GI: Changed: Change LightTransport.BufferSlice to carry a type annotation, indicating the type of elements in the buffer slice.

- GI: Changed: Changed LightTransport.IDeviceContext.WriteBuffer and LightTransport.IDeviceContext.ReadBuffer to take a LightTransport.BufferSlice rather than a LightTransport.BufferID. This lets you provide an offset for your reads and writes.

- GI: Changed: Renamed LightTransport.IDeviceContext.WaitForAsyncOperation and LightTransport.IDeviceContext.IsAsyncOperationComplete to LightTransport.IDeviceContext.Wait and LightTransport.IDeviceContext.IsComplete.

- Graphics: Changed: BatchDrawCommand.visibleCount no longer has to be set to 1 when BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition is set

- Graphics: Changed: HLSL `min16float` variables are now translated to MSL `float` in all CPU visible buffers \(e.g. Constant Buffers, Structured Buffers, Vertex Shader Input\). When accessing these values inside shaders, they are casted to MSL `half` \(16-bit\) for faster arithmetic operations. Any project that uses `min16float` or `half` in shaders and accesses this data as 16-float \(from CPU\) on iOS is incompatible with this change. For these cases, a new `#pragma metal_fxc_allow_float16_in_cpu_visible_buffers` was added so that HLSL `min16float` variables are converted to MSL `half` in all CPU visible buffers \(just like before\).

- HDRP: Added: Fix missing API to get deformation buffer
    (UUM-48355)

- HDRP: Added: New forceVisible API on light to get information from a light from SRP even if it is not in frustrum.

- Physics: Removed: Removed long deprecated type field SoftJointLimit.bouncyness

- Physics: Removed: Removed long deprecated type field SoftJointLimit.damper

- Physics: Removed: Removed long deprecated type field SoftJointLimit.spring

- Scripting: Added: Constructor to TextAsset which takes a ReadOnlySpan of bytes.

    New methods on HierarchyFlattened class: EnumerateChildren to get a children enumerable for the specified node, GetChildrenCountRecursive to get number of children including children of children.<br>
    New methods on HierarchyViewModel class: several methods to manipulate and query bit flags on nodes, such as SetFlags, ToggleFlags, ClearFlags, HasFlags, DoesNotHaveFlags, GetNodesWithFlags, GetIndicesWithFlags, EnumerateNodesWithFlags and EnumerateNodesWithoutFlags.<br>
    New classes and structs to support new functionality: several new enumerables, such as HierarchyFlattenedNodeChildren, HierarchyNodeChildren and HierarchyViewNodesEnumerable.<br>
    A new enum flags HierarchyNodeFlags used by the HierarchyViewModel.<br>
    A new struct HierarchyNodeMapUnmanaged to store unmanaged data per node that is O\(1\) lookup time, implemented as a sparse array.

- Scripting: Changed: Several methods have had their parameter taking a Span changed to a ReadOnlySpan, to indicate that the content of the span will not be modified and only used as input.<br>
    Hierarchy.RegisterNodeTypeHandler now returns the handler.<br>
    The Hierarchy.SortChildren method got a new parameter, to enable sorting recursively.

- SRP Core: Added: callbacks when RenderPipeline is created or disposed.
    ([UUM-20646](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/srp-constructor-is-called-when-the-scene-has-not-been-loaded))

- UI Toolkit: Added: A string array named paths to the drag and drop API to reproduce what was available in the Editor.

- UI Toolkit: Added: `disablePlayModeTint` on `VisualElement` to opt-out of playmode tinting. Applies hierarchically so a user could retrieve the `rootVisualElemen`t on an `EditorWindow` to disable playmode tinting entirely on the window.

- UI Toolkit: Changed: Added Column.comparison and sortingMode on MultiColumnListView and MultiColumnTreeView to give a default sorting algorithm for sortable columns. This replaces the previous sortingEnabled API.

- Universal RP: Added: Added RG path only function for AddRenderPasses using ContextContainer instead of RenderingData

- Universal RP: Added: ContextContainer items used as frame data for UniversalRenderer and Renderer2D e.g. UniversalLightData &amp; UniversalCameraData.

- Universal RP: Added: Made Main Light Shadow Resolution and Additional Light Shadow Resolution settings public in the URP Asset.

- Universal RP: Added: Made the cascade split settings public in the URP Asset.
