### 6000.0.39f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Shadergraph: Added a new set of sample content - Shader Graph UGUI Shaders - to the Shader Graph package that contains examples of how to use the new Canvas target in Shader Graph to create dynamic UI elements. This new sample can be imported from the Sample tab of the Package Manager after selecting the Shader Graph package

- 2D: Fixed TilemapRenderer in SRPBatch mode from applying Tilemap Color twice when rendering Tiles.
    ([UUM-92738](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tilemaprenderer-color-will-display-significantly-darker-when-switching-a-tilemap-to-srp-batch-from-chunk-or-individual-mode))

- Animation: Fixed an issue by adding a minimum width to the Layers and Parameters panel in the Animator Controller window.
