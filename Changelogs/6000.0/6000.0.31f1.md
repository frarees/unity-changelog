### 6000.0.31f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Asset Import: Reduced peak memory usage at the end of Asset Importing, caused by the Bumpmap material/texture check.
    (UUM-88920)

- Core: Added the ability to configure the number of asset garbage collector helper threads via command line \(-gc-helper-count N\) and via boot.config file \(gc-helper-count=N\).

    (UUM-87185)

- Windows: On Windows, we reduced how often we re-enumerate the list of audio devices, which causes a main thread stall. If an audio output device is added or removed, but the default device does not change, then we no longer re-enumerate. If an audio input device is added or removed, we defer the re-enumerate operation until the Unity app actually requests the updated list of microphones via C\#.
