### 6000.0.16f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Core: Optimized BootConfig lookups in XR and Shader code to improve performance.

- Editor: Improved string usage among core engine classes, which results in fewer allocations and small performance improvements.

- GI: Cached the result of rasterization during lightmap baking. This speeds up repeated bakes of the same scene significantly.

- Universal RP: Improve the sample code in the URP Post Processing Effect \(with Volume\) template to remove a copy render pass.



#### API Changes

- GI: Added: Embree.GpuBvh.BuildOptions.isTopLevel, indicating whether to build a top level acceleration structure.

- GI: Deprecated: EditorSettings.enableCookiesInLightmapper. Cookies are always supported by the lightmapper.

- GI: Removed: EditorSettings.disableCookiesInLightmapper. Cookies are always supported by the lightmapper.



#### Changes

- Installer: Changed the default IDE suggestion on macOS to be Visual Studio Code since Visual Studio for macOS is no longer supported by Microsoft.



#### Fixes

- Android: Fixed a synchronized show-hide softInput operations issue.

    (UUM-77227)

- Editor: The behaviour of `EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent` is reversed, so it does provide an icon when the reference is null.

- Graphics: Fixed linear fog rendering artifacts on Adreno GPUs when Vulkan is the graphics API.
    ([UUM-61728](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linear-fog-plus-detail-maps-equals-problems-on-android))

- Kernel: Fixed a player crash that would occur due to internal data races when loading assets.
    ([UUM-72557](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/virtualfilesystem-crash-because-of-data-races))

- Profiler: Fixed "Page range is outside of system region range. Please report a bug\!" error for captured memory snapshots and opened in the Memory Profiler packaged, caused by Unity Objects getting created in-between of capturing the Managed Heap and Native Object data. Snapshots before this fix are not fixed by this change but future captures won't have the same issue. This also fixes cases where Unity Objects in a Memory Snapshot might have pointed at invalid data for their Managed Shell, which may have been most notable with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject types. This may also have fixed a vanishingly small amount of instances of reported "Leaked Managed Shell" objects where the Native Object part of the object got destroyed just after the managed Heap data was captured. The close timing makes the likelihood of all of these issues very rare and more likely the longer it takes to capture a snapshot.
    (UUM-77449)

    ([UUM-74498](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/application-dot-isfocused-initially-returns-true-when-entering-the-play-mode-with-the-game-window-set-to-play-unfocused))

- Shadergraph: Disallowed shader variant related settings to be set to negative values.
    ([UUM-76472](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-preview-variant-limit-can-be-set-to-a-negative-value))

- Shadergraph: Fixed a null reference exception when shader variant project settings were changed under certain circumstances.
    ([UUM-75697](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-and-value-does-not-change-when-changing-the-shader-variant-limit-value-after-exiting-the-play-mode))

    ([UUM-76008](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graph-inspector-is-not-redrawn-when-user-is-changing-the-precision-of-a-node-via-right-click))

    ([UUM-73445](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-regarding-ui-toolkit-sourcegenerator-are-thrown-when-opening-a-project-with-muse-behavior-and-app-ui-packages-installed))

    ([UUM-75225](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-selection-changes-when-the-parent-item-is-toggled-if-a-child-item-is-selected-in-treeview))

- UI Toolkit: Provided a better error message when the generic version of `UQuery.Q` is called on a null element.
    (UUM-77897)

- Universal RP: Fixed an issue with `XRCopyDepth` not working when running in RenderGraph.

- Universal RP: Fixed XR isLastCamera check.
    (UUM-75655)

    ([UUM-75469](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-sound-of-videos-in-video-player-is-lost-when-bluetooth-headphones-are-connected-or-disconnected))
