### 6000.0.7f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Package Manager: Added a new Editor `-upmLogFile` command line argument that specifies a custom file path for UPM log output.

- Shaders: Added support for the `#push_line 1234 filename` and `#pop_line` directives to the Shader Pre-processor.



#### Improvements

- 2D: Add toggle to allow users to generate an outline for all Sprites in a Texture, even if the Sprites already had an outline defined.

- 2D: In the Sprite Editor, users now can:<br>
    - Copy an outline from a module and persist the outline to the other module<br>
    - Copy and paste the outline from the alternate module \(Outline to Physics Shape and Physics Shape to Outline\)<br>
    - Copy and paste all outlines from the alternate module

- Documentation: Added a new workflow to the Timeline Workflows documentation: The Create a custom Notes marker workflow, which demonstrates how to create a custom marker for adding notes to Timeline instances. This workflow also demonstrates how to change the default appearance of a custom marker with scripting and a Unity Style Sheet \(USS\).

- Editor: Added a warning for lights baked in shadow mask mode falling back to fully baked.

- Editor: Added Prefab Variant to the Shortcut area of the Create Menu.
    ([UUM-73105](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-variant-creation-is-too-hidden-when-creating-via-context-menu))

- Graphics: Improved vertex data copy for Dynamic Batching.

- HDRP: Added SG custom refraction example to Transparency sample.

- HDRP: Adding environment samples showcasing environment effects together.

- iOS: Print a warning if there are symlinks in a framework when building on Windows.

- iOS: Validate that frameworks contain Info.plist file.

- macOS: Added a better error message for duplicate source file plugins.

- Package Manager: Package icons positions are now consistent with the type of information they pass on to the users.

- Physics: Improved the behavior of MeshCollider mesh cooking by allowing again the use of meshes where the distance between two vertices of a triangle is greater than 500 units. Using meshes as such can break simulation \(especially character controller\) and query stability in PhysX. This issue would only occur when MeshColliderCookingOptions.WeldColocatedVertices or MeshColliderCookingOptions.EnableMeshCleaning would be enabled when baking a triangle mesh.

- Physics: Improved the label for the physics integration dropdown in order to clarify what the property does.

- Physics: Improved the message provided when using a mesh that contains triangles where the distance between any two vertices is greater than 500 units. The message now effectively reflects the guidance within the PhysX SDK documentation.

- Scene/Game View: EditorTool buttons now automatically refresh state if respective tool's availability changes and unavailable tools are shown as disabled instead of hidden.

- UI Elements: Improved performance of MultiColumnListView and MultiColumnTreeView when changing the visibility status of columns.<br>
    A rebuild will now be scheduled instead of performed after each status change.
    ([UUM-72241](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/multicolumnlistview-causes-a-memory-leak-when-repeatedly-shown-and-hidden))

- VisionOS: Plugin path "Assets/Plugins/VisionOS/" is now recognized and auto-selects VisionOS as compatible platform.

- VisionOS: Soft Particle effects now account for foveation when sampling the depth buffer.



#### API Changes

- Android: Added: Added AndroidConfiguration class which contains properties for many aspects of Android application, see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration for more information.

- Android: Added: Added AndroidJNI.InvokeAttached which you can you use from threads to invoke java methods without the worry of calling AttachCurrentThread/DetachCurrentThread.

- Android: Added: Added UnityEngine.AndroidApplication class which you can use to get current activity instance, invoke on UI or Main thread, and subscribe to configuration changes.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added EnumButtonsAttribute. This can be used to display an enum field with a ToggleButtonGroup instead of a popup field.



#### Changes

- Editor: Update 7-Zip to 24.06.

- Physics 2D: Change the default value of contact-threshold to zero \(off\) by default for new projects and improve its tooltip.

- Serialization: Changed alignment in SerializedFile from 8 to 16 bytes, and added 16 bytes alignment into ResourceFileBuilder to improve patching results on some platforms.
