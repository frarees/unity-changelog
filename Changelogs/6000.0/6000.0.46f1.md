### 6000.0.46f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Android: -androidChainedSignalHandlerBehavior legacy never worked for GameActivity, which is expected. It's now explicitly mentioned in the documentation.

- Build System: Improved logging for the "Read the full binlog without getting a BuildFinishedMessage" internal build error, so we can see if the build was cancelled from the editor process.



#### Changes

- Android: Add Android SDK 36 support.

- Android: Predictive Back Support is now enabled by default on new projects.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Disable saving of default Tile Palette tools when not are set.
    ([UUM-100964](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/argumentoutofrangeexception-after-saving-reseting-and-re-add-default-tile-palette-tools-to-the-list-in-preferences-window))

- 2D: Fixed case where Inconsistent rendering of Sprite Shapes occurs when a Fill Material is not selected or a custom shader material is set as the Edge Material.
    ([UUM-99031](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inconsistent-rendering-of-sprite-shapes-occurs-when-a-fill-material-is-not-selected-or-a-custom-shader-material-is-set-as-the-edge-material))

- 2D: Fixed case where Video is not rendered in Video Player when Material Override is set as the Render Mode and a SpriteRenderer is used
    ([UUM-98459](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/video-is-not-rendered-in-video-player-when-material-override-is-set-as-the-render-mode-and-a-spriterenderer-is-used))

- AI: Fixed issue where collision solver for AI agents pushed agents away from stationary, non-carving obstacle center or segment midpoint, causing agents to accelerate along obstacle boundaries as they move to target locations. The effect was very obvious, especially for elongated non-square .obstacles. The collision solver now pushes agents away from nearest contact point when colliding with said obstacle.
    ([UUM-58165](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/agent-accelerates-if-blocked-by-a-stationary-non-carved-obstacle))

- Android: Fixed a regression for legacy crash handler, where -androidChainedSignalHandlerBehavior legacy stopped working for Activity. Note: this legacy option will be removed in future Unity versions and you will not be able to force legacy crash handler behavior.
    ([UUM-98269](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/fatal-signal-6-sigabrt-is-shown-in-the-console-instead-of-crash-details-when-androidchainedsignalhandlerbehavior-is-set-to-legacy))

- Audio: Fixed a crash during initialization of audio, on certain platforms where exclusive access to the output device is possible, when the default audio device driver can fail to initialize with specified parameters in the audio settings.
    (UUM-99985)
