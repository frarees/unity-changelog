### 6000.0.2f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Package Manager: Improved samples tab layout.

- Package Manager: Improved warning window to show .unitypackage dependencies that are about to be installed

- SRP Core: Improved Render Graph warning message in URP when missing RecordRenderGraph implementation.

- SRP Core: Render Graph Viewer: Display subpass &amp; attachment index.
    (UUM-69886)

- SRP Core: Render Graph Viewer: New icon &amp; tooltip if there are multiple usage details for a resource block.
    (UUM-69886)



#### API Changes

- Scripting: Added: The virtual method Initialize on HierarchyNodeTypeHandlerBase is no longer internal, and can now be used when multiple instances depends on each other.
    (UUM-70045)

- Scripting: Added: TouchScreenKeyboard.inputFieldAppearance, which can be used to determine on-screenkeyboard input field traits.

- Scripting: Changed: The class HierarchyNodeTypeHandlerBase constructor no longer has any parameters, the default constructor will be used now, and is guaranteed to be called.
    (UUM-70045)

- Scripting: Changed: The class HierarchyNodeTypeHandlerBase no longer implements the IDisposable interface, so that Dispose cannot be called manually on instances. There is still the Dispose method with a disposing parameter available to override if needed.
    (UUM-70045)



#### Changes

- Android: Prefer to use android.view.WindowMetrics.getBounds instead of DisplayMetrics.getMetrics/getRealMetrics when device API level is 30 or higher.

- Build System: include bee_backend.pdb next to bee_backend.exe on windows installs.



#### Fixes

- Android: UTK input field cursor will be always visible now when TouchScreenKeyboard opens, independent of hideInput value, when running on GameActivity. The reason is TouchScreenKeyboard.hideInput doesn't do anything on GameActivity, input field is always hidden.
