### Final 6000.0.0f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Android: Added the Addressables for Android \(com.unity.addressables.android\) package. This package provides Play Asset Delivery support for Addressables.

- DX12: Added support for indirect Dispatch Rays \(part of DXR 1.1\). The method is similar to `RayTracingShader.Dispatch`, but the three dispatch dimensions are retrieved from a GraphicsBuffer. Added `RayTracingShader.DispatchIndirect` and a new `CommandBuffer.DispatchRays` signature. Added `SystemInfo.supportsIndirectDispatchRays` capability status.

- Editor: Added a custom menu on `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings`.

- Editor: Added a piercing menu that you can open with Ctrl + Right-click in the Scene view. The piercing menu provides a UI that lists all GameObjects under the pointer. GameObjects in the menu can be highlighted and selected.

- Editor: Added the `ForceNoCrunch` option to the *Build Windows &gt; Asset Import Overrides &gt; Texture Compression* dropdown which forces all textures to disable crunch compression and re-import.

- Editor: Added `Additional App IDs` to Steam ID Provider Editor Settings for Multiple App ID support.

- Editor: Integrated new build profile icons.

- Editor: Introduced `IRenderPipelineResources` to host SRP resources, which uses the `ResourcePath` to auto-load resources.

- Editor: The Build Profile Diagnostic checkbox is no longer available because the Build Settings window has been replaced with the Build Profile window.

- Graphics: Added a new backend rendering path for rigid GameObjects in Unity that puts them through the Batch Render Group API when the option is enabled on the Render Pipeline asset \('GPU Resident Drawer'\). This functionality creates a persistent GPU state for these objects and they will be rendered by the same fast batching path as used by the entities renderer.

- Graphics: Added small-mesh culling for gpu-driven instances.

- Graphics: Added support for GPU occlusion culling of instances that are compatible with the 'GPU Resident Drawer', which can be enabled in the Render Pipeline asset.

- Graphics: Added UITK support for CustomPostProcessOrder.

- Graphics: Adding a new per batch layer filtering setting for BatchRendererGroup. This setting is useful for the context of culling out specific batches that go through the batch renderer group.

- Graphics: Enabled SpeedTree GameObjects rendering using GPU Resident Drawer.

- Graphics: Updated the default `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings` Inspector to trigger notifications when a value is modified.

- HDRP: Added AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 \(FSR2\) Unity script bindings and HDRP integration.

- HDRP: Added support for overriding material properties such as smoothness, albedo, and normal maps on all materials to facilitate material and lighting debugging. The material override feature in HDRP is available through the Rendering Debugger's Lighting panel when rendering through the path tracer pipeline.

- HDRP: Added support for Spatial Temporal Post-Processing \(STP\) upscaling solution.

- HDRP: Added the Sky Occlusion feature to Adaptive Probe Volumes \(APV\), to allow time of day with static probe volumes.

- HDRP: Disabled storing of baked data as Streaming Asset in Adaptive Probe Volumes \(APV\) to make it compatible with Asset Bundles and Addressables.

- HDRP: Improved on existing Mipmap Streaming debug views and added more. The current offering in HDRP is consistent with what URP offers.

- iOS: Added .xcframework plugins support.

- iOS: Added Apple Privacy Manifest support.

- Particles: Add `BakeTexture` and `BakeTrailsTexture` scripting methods.

- Particles: Added the Custom Vertex Streams feature for particle trails.

- Shadergraph: Added a customizable Heatmap color mode, which by default displays the estimated performance impact of each node in a Shader Graph.

- Shadergraph: Added a new sample content pack that can be installed with the Package Manager. The samples contain descriptions, examples, and break downs for a majority of the nodes in Shader Graph. These samples help users understand the inner workings of the nodes and see examples of how they work and how they can be used.

- Shadergraph: Added a zoom step size option in the user preferences.

- Shadergraph: Added new shortcuts for adding new nodes and toggling sub-window visibility, and moved several existing shortcuts to the Shortcut Manager.

With this setting enabled, URP renders the post-processing output into a render texture with the alpha channel. Previously the post-processing workflow in URP discarded the alpha channel \(replaced alpha values with 1\) in the final output. The format is RGBA8 for SDR and RGBA16F for HDR.

- URP: Added Adaptive Probe Volumes \(APV\) Lighting Scenario Blending to URP

- URP: Added APV Sky Occlusion support for URP.

- URP: Added Render Graph Viewer. Access it through the *Window &gt; Rendering* menu. The tool helps to visualize and debug resource usage of Render Passes in the Render Graph framework.
