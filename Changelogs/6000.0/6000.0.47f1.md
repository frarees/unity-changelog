- UI Toolkit: Fixed missing synchronization that triggered assertion failures in UpdateBufferRanges.
    ([UUM-101410](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gfxdevice-updatebufferranges-when-running-uibuilder-tests))

- VFX Graph: Fixed an unexpected destructive workflow with null SRP asset in case of SG/VFX Output usage.
    (UUM-101634)

- Web: Fixed an issue to corrected the name of the background image file in the output directory when using "Name Files as Hashes".
    ([UUM-96178](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/background-image-name-is-not-being-hashed-when-using-a-webgl-build-with-the-hashed-names-option))

- Windows: Fixed a few related issues where if the Unity project/player settings were set to the Quad speaker mode, we would still output sound to the front center channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. Similarly, if Unity is set to use the surround \(5.0\) speaker mode, we would still output sound to the LFE channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. This has now been fixed.
    ([UUM-52906](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-uses-a-centre-speaker-when-defaultspeakermode-is-set-to-quad))
