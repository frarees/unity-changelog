### 6000.0.64f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- AI: Improved performance of sampling the nearest position on the navmesh.
    (UUM-117415)

- Documentation: Reformatted the documentation page for "Cubemap.CreateExternalTexture" and added missing information. Corrected expected pointer type for D3D12 on all "CreateExternalTexture" pages \(always "ID3D12Resource*"\). Minor polish pass on the page for "Texture3D.CreateExternalTexture", no actual changes in content outside of the mentioned D3D12 change.
    (UUM-119638)

- Editor: Improved interactivity of progress bar when opening the "Compile and Show Code" dropdown in the Shader Inspector.
    ([UUM-97524](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-time-and-the-number-of-shader-variants-highly-increase-when-using-a-lit-shader-graph-and-clicking-the-pop-up-menu-of-the-compile-and-show-code))

- Editor: Minimum width of the Sprite Editor Window has been increased so when the window is undocked it cannot be resized so that the window is too thin to display all the buttons on the toolbar.
    (UUM-127566)



#### Changes

- Multiplayer: Removing references to Multiplayer Widgets from documentation after deprecation of package.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Sprite Editor Window Custom Outline and Physics Custom Outline inspector window is disabled when in playmode.
    ([UUM-125376](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editable-overlays-present-in-custom-outline-and-custom-physics-shape-sections-of-sprite-editor-window-when-selecting-a-sprite-from-hierarchy))
