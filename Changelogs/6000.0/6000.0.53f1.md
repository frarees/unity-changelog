    ([UUM-104888](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/custom-elements-not-visible-in-ui-builder-when-defined-in-a-namespace-starting-with-unity))



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed an issue in the Shadow Caster 2D shape editor that could cause exceptions to be thrown.
    (UUM-97647)

- 2D: Fixed an issue with the TilemapRenderer when the TilemapRenderer has a Mask Interaction set to None and the user uses a shader which utilises the stencil buffer, and the stencil settings in the shader are not respected.
    ([UUM-109109](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tilemap-renderer-does-not-reflect-the-stencil-buffer-when-the-tilemap-renderer-mode-is-set-to-chunk))

- Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause the main thread to stall when loading projects/scenes.
    ([UUM-100966](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/main-thread-stalling-when-loading-audio-source-asset-asynchronously-while-preloading-another-audio-source-asset))

    ([UUM-104751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/overrides-in-nested-prefabs-are-ignored-when-importing))

- DX12: Stencil reference value is applied correctly when using graphics jobs.

- Editor: Fixed an issue where the Unity Editor would still open after a user terminated the launch screen during project load.
    ([UUM-107863](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-editor-opens-when-the-window-is-closed-right-after-launch))

- Editor: Fixed floating license cleanup and concurrent license update in LicensingClient 1.17.1.

- Editor: Fixed method decorated with HideInCallstack attribute being opened by IDE instead of the caller method.
    ([UUM-99776](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hidden-method-is-opened-in-ide-when-double-clicking-the-log-message-in-the-console-that-has-the-hideincallstackattribute))

    ([UUM-110119](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/preview-window-buttons-are-pushed-out-by-header-text))

    ([UUM-101193](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unityexception-get-disableapplymaterialpropertydrawers-can-only-be-called-from-the-main-thread))

- Input System: Fixed a problem where two devices were detected when connecting a wireless Nintendo Switch Pro controller on Windows.
    (UUM-109997)

    (UUM-110170)

- Profiler: Fixed Player hang during Autoconnect on long Player initialization.
    ([UUM-101218](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-unresponsive-when-building-a-specific-project-with-autoconnect-profiler-enabled))
