### 6000.0.20f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Version Control: Added a setting to automatically add new files to source control.

- Version Control: You can now delete non-empty branches that have not been merged anywhere.



#### Improvements

- DX12: Optimized binding resources to ray tracing hit shaders by using root constant buffers. In the HDRP Sample Scene, the cost for writing hit group shader table for the ray traced reflection effect is reduced by 15-20%.

- GI: Added a warning for when Adaptive Probe Volumes run out of VRAM budget, and streaming isn't enabled.
    (UUM-55408)

- Version Control: Improved the dialog to install Unity Version Control from the Editor.



#### API Changes

- DX12: Added: Added "Allow Graphics Jobs in Editor" button in the Preferences/Jobs window.

- Editor: Added: Exposed BuildSummary.buildType, allowing for querying which kind of build a BuildReport represents.
    (UUM-79124)

- Graphics: Added: Added solid angle culling in RayTracingAccelerationStructure.CullInstances.<br>
    Added RayTracingInstanceCullingFlags.EnableSolidAngleCulling and RayTracingInstanceCullingConfig.minSolidAngle culling parameters.  The reference point \(apex\) is RayTracingInstanceCullingConfig.LODParameters.cameraPosition.



#### Changes

- Package Manager: Updated the tagging system in the Package Manager UI so that tags are now coherent for packages coming from any source.
