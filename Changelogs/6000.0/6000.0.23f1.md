(_6000.0.23f1 release notes are below this section_)

#### Features

- Android: Added the Addressables for Android \(com.unity.addressables.android\) package. This package provides Play Asset Delivery support for Addressables.

- DX12: Added support for indirect Dispatch Rays \(part of DXR 1.1\). The method is similar to `RayTracingShader.Dispatch`, but the three dispatch dimensions are retrieved from a GraphicsBuffer. Added `RayTracingShader.DispatchIndirect` and a new `CommandBuffer.DispatchRays` signature. Added `SystemInfo.supportsIndirectDispatchRays` capability status.

- Editor: Added a custom menu on `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings`.

- Editor: Added a piercing menu that you can open with Ctrl + Right-click in the Scene view. The piercing menu provides a UI that lists all GameObjects under the pointer. GameObjects in the menu can be highlighted and selected.

- Editor: Added the `ForceNoCrunch` option to the *Build Windows &gt; Asset Import Overrides &gt; Texture Compression* dropdown which forces all textures to disable crunch compression and re-import.

- Editor: Added `Additional App IDs` to Steam ID Provider Editor Settings for Multiple App ID support.

- Editor: Integrated new build profile icons.

- Editor: Introduced `IRenderPipelineResources` to host SRP resources, which uses the `ResourcePath` to auto-load resources.

- Editor: The Build Profile Diagnostic checkbox is no longer available because the Build Settings window has been replaced with the Build Profile window.

- Graphics: Added a new backend rendering path for rigid GameObjects in Unity that puts them through the Batch Render Group API when the option is enabled on the Render Pipeline asset \('GPU Resident Drawer'\). This functionality creates a persistent GPU state for these objects and they will be rendered by the same fast batching path as used by the entities renderer.

- Graphics: Added small-mesh culling for gpu-driven instances.

- Graphics: Added support for GPU occlusion culling of instances that are compatible with the 'GPU Resident Drawer', which can be enabled in the Render Pipeline asset.

When accessing these values inside shaders, they are casted to MSL `half` \(16-bit\) for faster arithmetic operations. Any project that uses `min16float` or `half` in shaders and accesses this data as 16-float \(from CPU\) on iOS is incompatible with this change. For these cases, a new `#pragma metal_fxc_allow_float16_in_cpu_visible_buffers` was added so that HLSL `min16float` variables are converted to MSL `half` in all CPU visible buffers \(just like before\).

    New methods on HierarchyViewModel class: several methods to manipulate and query bit flags on nodes, such as SetFlags, ToggleFlags, ClearFlags, HasFlags, DoesNotHaveFlags, GetNodesWithFlags, GetIndicesWithFlags, EnumerateNodesWithFlags and EnumerateNodesWithoutFlags.<br>
    New classes and structs to support new functionality: several new enumerables, such as HierarchyFlattenedNodeChildren, HierarchyNodeChildren and HierarchyViewNodesEnumerable.<br>
    A new enum flags HierarchyNodeFlags used by the HierarchyViewModel.<br>
    A new struct HierarchyNodeMapUnmanaged to store unmanaged data per node that is O\(1\) lookup time, implemented as a sparse array.

- Physics: Removed compatibility code that allowed Unity to load joints directly from assets created in Unity 4.x and older.

- Physics: `OnTriggerEnter` events now have their matching `OnTriggerStay` dispatched after an `OnTriggerEnter` event, rather than wait for all `OnTriggerEnter` events to be dispatched.

- Profiler: Removed extraneous calls to `UpdateRendererBoundingVolumes` when executing an empty `CommandBuffer`.
    ([UUM-33237](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gaphics-dot-executecommandbuffer-adds-unwanted-updaterendererboundingvolumes-calls-in-profiler))

- Profiler: The Highlights profiler module is now visible by default.

### 6000.0.23f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Package: Added the Character Controller package, version 1.2.4.



#### Improvements

- Documentation: Added a Multiplayer overview page to summarize Unity's multiplayer packages and services.

- HDRP: Added a slider to High Quality Line Rendering Volume Component to specify when to omit depth and motion vector write if alpha is too low.

- HDRP: Added the option to compose hair before color pyramid but after clouds.

- HDRP: Allow using Solid Angle Culling Mode in Ray Tracing Settings volume override. This ray tracing culling mode rejects objects that are small enough or that are far away from the camera position based on their projected solid angle. These will not be added to the ray tracing acceleration structure.

- Package Manager: Concurrent operations made via the `UnityEditor.PackageManager.Client` class will now be processed sequentially instead of failing with a concurrency error.

- Package Manager: Optimized handling of built-in packages with type module to avoid unnecessary network calls and file operations.



#### Changes

- Documentation: The documentation for the Universal Render Pipeline \(URP\) in Unity 6 Preview has moved from a separate URP site to the Unity Manual. URP site pages now redirect to the Unity Manual pages.

- Graphics: Use the unified RenderGraph compiler instead of defaulting to the older HDRP implementation for OpenGLES.

- Package: Promoted deprecated version of Sequences package.

- Package Manager: Changed the min-width of the package manager window, sidebar, and package list.
    ([UUM-72856](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-manager-window-remove-slash-install-button-is-not-visible-when-the-window-has-low-width))

- URP: In the Render Graph Viewer, you can now open the tool when the compatibility mode is enabled.
    (UUM-74128)
