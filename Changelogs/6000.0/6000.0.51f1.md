### 6000.0.51f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Package Manager: Added `pinnedPackages` optional property to the project manifest. This feature forces specified direct dependencies to use their exact manifest versions during package resolution and project update.



#### Improvements

- Documentation: Removed the CreateRenderGraphTexture API references from the create-custom-renderer-feature page.

- Physics: Better tooltips for PhysicsSettings window.
    (UUM-105527)



#### API Changes

- Kepler: Added: Launch Arguments API.



#### Changes

- Package Manager: Removed the `overrideBuiltIns` property making all `builtin` packages with semver version unable to be overridden.

- Editor: Added emoji font fallback on WIN, OSX and Linux.
    (UUM-97030)
