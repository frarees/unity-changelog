### 6000.0.65f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- IL2CPP: Fixed some of the problems building the il2cpp.sln that is available to source code customers.

- iOS: Added workaround for ios calling metal displaylink callback recursively on some devices when loading webkit from the \[NSAttributedString initWithData:options:documentAttributes:error:\] call done in plugins inside unity playerloop.

- Physics: Added the ability to specify if internal collision, trigger and joint event buffers should be de-allocated with a specific time interval. Effectively allowing memory pressure to be reduced when a physics scene's preparation stage runs. These settings can be found in "Project Settings -&gt; Physics -&gt; Settings -&gt; GameObjects tab, under the "Release Simulation Buffers" foldout.
    ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))

- Physics: Exposed log verbosity as a option within the physics pane in order to allow users to suppress some warnings/logs coming out of the PhysX integration. The new setting can be found under Edit-&gt;Project Settings-&gt;Physics-&gt;Settings within the GameObject tab.
    (PHYS-681)



#### API Changes

- Physics: Added: Added Physics. method for cases when it is undesirable to enable auto de-allocation of events and instead a manual approach is desired where memory can be recovered during specific events.
    ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))



#### Changes

    ([UUM-125389](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/previously-deleted-defaultlookdevprofile-is-present-when-upgrading-the-editor-version))
