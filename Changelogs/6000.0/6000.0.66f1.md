### 6000.0.66f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Editor: Added a new option "Force GC on Scene Load" to the Editor Scene Handling section of the Project Settings which when disabled will prevent a forced GC and unused asset unloading every time a scene is loaded in the editor.  This can improve performance \(sometimes significantly\) although it may also affect exactly when managed object finalizers are called which in rare circumstances might be an issue depending on the project.

- Version Control: Added a cset by cset diff panel in the branches view.

- Version Control: Added a properties panel for the selected changeset/shelveset.

- Version Control: Added branch name\(s\) to the branch deletion dialog.

- Version Control: Added empty state in the history view.

- Version Control: Added specific empty states for Pending/Incoming Changes with filters.



#### Improvements

- Graphics: Handle case where vulkan pipeline cache file could be corrupted and cause vkCreatePipelineCache to fail.



#### Changes

- Editor: Changed previous fix to only happen in Editor outside of Play Mode.

- Version Control: Displayed progress indicator overlaying the view.

- Version Control: Implemented a "clever" truncation of paths.

- Version Control: Moved incoming and shelves notifications to the top bar.

- Version Control: Redesigned all the views and dialogs.

- Version Control: Redesigned the main panel to include a top breadcrumb.

- Version Control: Renamed toolbar dropdown to comply with a 120px max width limit in 6.5.
