### 6000.0.17f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Editor: Improved Editor performance when performing drag, drop, copy, and paste operations with complex prefabs.

- Graphics: Added shader pragma `disable_ray_payload_size_checks` that can be used in .raytrace shaders to disable ray payload size compatibility checks between ray generation and hit shaders.

- IL2CPP: Support volatile stores using the ldind.ref opcode.

- Physics: Added a new memory root "Physics Debugger" for tracking the memory allocated by the Physics Debugger tool.



#### Changes

- Documentation: Renamed Game Server Hosting to Multiplay Hosting as part of rebrand.

- iOS: Use the f16 color format for the metal layer and internally by default when using "wide color" \(P3 color pace\).



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed an issue where Tile Palette window would not update when creating first palette or error messages would not show up on when it reached an error state.
    (UUM-77329)

- Android: Fixed an issue with native plugin being skipped for ARMv7 architecture if target CPU is not set.
    ([UUM-77679](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-libnativememorybinary-dot-so-is-not-being-generated-when-exporting-the-project))

- Android: Fixed misspelling in `AndroidPluginImporterUtilities` name.
    (UUM-77692)

- Asset Pipeline: Increased the integrity of the asset database to minimize the risk of corruping a library folder. It changes the way we flush in-memory data to the database internally.<br>
    Unfortunately this change might introduce a performance regression for users with spinning disk hard-drives. To accommodate this user group, we are introducing the command-line flag `sacrificeDBIntegrityForPerformance`, which you can use to opt out of this new behaviour and fall back to the way it has worked before.
    ([UUM-14959](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-getassetcachedinfov2-when-opening-a-project))

- Editor: Fixed a bug where a restart editor prompt appeared when users change the Incremental GC or Active Input Handling settings for inactive platforms or build profiles.
    ([UUM-70192](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-settings-common-configuration-incremental-gc-slash-active-input-handler-non-active-build-profiles-shouldnt-ask-to-restart))

- Editor: Fixed an assert that could spam the console in the Linux Editor while in Play mode if the cursor was locked and the mouse was moved quickly.
    ([UUM-77694](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-gtk-errors-are-thrown-when-moving-the-mouse-too-fast))

- Editor: Fixed an Editor crash that would occur when using deferred rendering on cameras with a target render texture that fails to create, such as due to an unsupported texture format without compatible format fallbacks enabled. Now console errors are output instead.
    ([UUM-71811](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-rendertexture-create-when-opening-a-specific-project))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where errors where thrown when resizing the SceneView to 0 height or width.
    (UUM-76816)

- Editor: Fixed an issue where GPU Skinning options weren't being displayed on certain platforms.
    ([UUM-76079](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gpu-skinning-option-only-allows-for-enabling-or-disabling-it-when-the-windows-platform-is-selected))

- Editor: Fixed the overlay highlight so it is no longer visible when the menu is closed.
    (UUM-62419)

- Editor: Restored the tooltip to the View Tool button in the Tools overlay within the Scene view.
    ([UUM-78214](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tooltip-is-not-shown-when-hovering-cursor-over-view-tool-in-scene-view-tools-overlay))
