### 6000.0.4f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Editor: Added functionality for ModelImporter Presets that now allows the editing of clip list values and various animation settings.
    (UUM-63487)

- Editor: Faster check for the native subpasses limit and less duplicated code
    (UUM-65454)

- Editor: Ship arm64 7-Zip with the arm64 Windows Editor, instead of an x64 7-Zip

- Physics: Improved joint actor frame computation by ensuring initial actor frames only get set during initialization or when assigning a connected body to the joint.
    (PHYS-337)



#### API Changes

- Editor: Changed: \[Android\] "Resizable Window" setting has been renamed to "Resizeable Activity" and the default value is set to true for new projects.



#### Changes

- Editor: ObjectField label is now shown with 70% opacity for null values. This applies to both UI Toolkit and IMGUI.
    ([UUM-16396](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-icon-is-displayed-in-property-field-when-the-property-is-missing-a-value))

- Editor: `EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent` will no longer include an icon when the value is null. When the type of object is stated in the label, there is no need for the type icon to be shown. Showing an icon when the value is null can create confusion and when the value is "Missing" it can be perceived as there is a texture there named missing. If you still wish to have an icon you can use `AssetPreview.GetMiniTypeThumbnail(type);`
    ([UUM-16396](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-icon-is-displayed-in-property-field-when-the-property-is-missing-a-value))

    (UUM-71341)

    (UUM-71926)

    ([UUM-67833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/excluding-the-max-size-property-from-the-texture-importer-preset-the-imported-texture-will-be-resized-from-its-original-size-to-1x1))

    ([UUM-70629](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/directional-lights-are-cut-off-by-a-sharp-edge-when-passing-behind-a-volumetric-cloud))

- iOS: Fixed symlinks not being preserved in Frameworks when exporting an iOS project
    ([UUM-71657](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/symlinks-are-broken-when-a-package-which-contains-xcframework-plus-symlinks-is-added-through-unity-package-manager))

- iOS: fixed WebCamTexture being non readable
    ([UUM-70550](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-using-webcamtexture-dot-getpixels-to-capture-a-photo-doesnt-work-when-building-for-ios-device))

- Linux: Fixed touch freezes in Player when any mouse button is clicked
    ([UUM-70659](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-touch-freezes-in-player-when-any-mouse-button-is-clicked))

- Physics: Fixed an issue caused by a previous change to IgnoreCollision where clearing colliders from the ignorance list would stop their list ID effectively losing all other ignorance pairs those colliders had
    ([UUM-72148](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/collisionignore-resets-all-colliders-when-resetting-only-one-collider))

- Physics: Fixed an issue where joint local body frame would drift when anchors get recalculated. Causing the joint to lose it's initial rest frame.
    ([UUM-58304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-gameobject-with-a-hinge-joint-component-does-not-return-to-the-initial-position-when-the-use-motor-property-is-toggled-off))

- Physics: Related to the entry of UUM-58304, the main issue of the joint frame is fixed and the old behavior when no extended limits are present functions as expected. When extended limits are used in conjunction with a motorized hinge, the hinge joint local body frame no longer gets an offset based on the current transforms of the bodies attached to the joint. Previously this would happen due to the internal PhysX joint being recreated as either a 6-dof or hinge joint depending on a motor/spring being used or not.
    ([UUM-70652](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hinge-joint-transforms-are-reset-when-toggling-the-usemotor-property))

- Serialization: Fix enum fields when multiple C\# Generic types are present
    ([UUM-71808](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/enum-fields-are-rendered-as-integer-fields-when-serialized-in-a-nested-structure))

- UI Elements: Fixed the undo/redo in the MinMaxSlider control for the editor.
    ([UUM-54752](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/undoing-randomization-slider-changes-both-min-and-max-values))

- UI Elements: Isolated the text edition changes to the touch screen text editor.
    (UUM-71488)

- UI Toolkit: Fix some error when importing UXML asset when the system locale is in Turkish
    ([UUM-71670](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/trying-to-read-value-of-type-dimension-while-reading-a-value-of-type-enum-is-thrown-when-the-system-language-is-set-to-turkish))

- UI Toolkit: Fixed "NullReferenceException" error is thrown when calling UIDocument.runtimePanel while UIDocument is not yet initialized
    ([UUM-71707](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-error-is-thrown-when-calling-uidocument-dot-runtimepanel-in-onenable-with-executeineditmode))

- UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the editor binding system would update the underlying SerializedObject multiple times instead of once.
    (UUM-71919)

- UI Toolkit: Fixed element name being deleted when pressing the "ESC" key to cancel the renaming of an element in UI Builder.
    ([UUM-71820](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/element-name-is-deleted-when-pressing-the-esc-key-to-cancel-the-renaming-of-an-element-in-ui-builder))

- URP: Fixed SRP per-XRPass control to disable FR for intermediate render passes on untethered XR device if renderViewportScale is active when using URP RenderGraph
    (UUM-68027)

- Windows: Ensure that the information read from HID devices are readed correctly even when the driver isn't fully compliant.
    (UUM-72147)
