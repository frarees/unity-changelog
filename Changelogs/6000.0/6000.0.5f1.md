### 6000.0.5f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Shadergraph: Adds a new set of sample content - Production Ready Shaders - to the Shader Graph package.



#### Improvements

- DX12: Improved DX12 DRED info logging.
    (UUM-72380)

- Graphics: Rendering Debugger - Improved docs on how to open and how to use Rendering Debugger.
    ([UUM-71948](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rendering-debugger-shortcut-in-documentation-to-open-window-doesnt-work))

    ([UUM-28073](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/extremely-poor-performance-using-flex-direction-in-nested-foldouts-in-scrollview))



#### API Changes

- Scripting: Added: Added new method `string Hierarchy.GetPath(in HierarchyNode node)` which returns the textual path name of a node using names of nodes.
    (UUM-72599)



#### Fixes

- Android: Added ability to create filters for Android devices to allow or deny devices from using the Vulkan API when Vulkan is in the list of Graphics APIs.

Alternatively, with Android Vulkan Deny Filter List, one can limit certain devices from using the Vulkan API.
