### 6000.0.21f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Editor: Added the Asset Manager for Unity packages into *Package Manager &gt; Services &gt; Content Management* section.



#### Changes

- Package Manager: Changed the color of selected icons to be more consistent with other elements in light mode.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed an issue with Render Graph 2D light look up resource usage.
    (UUM-79452)

- Android: Fixed VideoPlayer test instabilities on some devices.
    (UUM-78032)

- Animation: Fixed an issue where entry transitions were not reporting warnings when one of their parameters was deleted.
    ([UUM-77622](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/deleting-a-parameter-in-an-animator-does-not-bring-up-a-warning-message-when-the-parameter-is-in-use-by-a-transition-from-the-entry-state))

- Editor: Added a more descriptive error message if `FileUtil::ReplaceDirectory()` fails to delete the destination directory.
    ([UUM-62633](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/fileutil-dot-replacedirectory-throws-an-uninformative-error-when-the-destination-path-contains-a-locked-file))

- Editor: Added support for Normal Map Encoding setting to be set with Build Profiles.
    ([UUM-73430](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-settings-mobile-rendering-normal-map-encoding-should-be-changed-pre-profile-and-not-globally))

- Editor: Fixed an issue that occurs when using dynamic color usage hints along with Text.
    ([UUM-72341](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-emoji-is-not-shown-in-the-ui-builder-viewport-and-the-game-view-when-it-is-placed-in-the-labels-text-attribute-and-usage-hints-is-set-to-dynamic-color))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where RPCore RenderGraphPerformanceTests are failing after additional error checking in ImportTexture.
    (UUM-81537)

- Editor: Fixed an issue where the built-in "Cycle Tool Modes" shortcut would never enter the GameObject context.
    (UUM-79497)

- Editor: Fixed an issue with splacescreens by using more specific keys for caching splash screens rather than clearing the splash screen cache on all changes. Clearing out the splash screen hash could cause race conditions that would cause a build to fail. If splash screens are not being cached properly, you can clear out the cache before a build by deleting the SplashScreenCache folder in the Library.

    ([UUM-77338](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgpu-32bit-floating-point-rendertexture-blending-is-not-working-when-built-for-webgpu))
