### 6000.0.15f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- GI: Added the ability to click on renderers in the Lightmap Preview window to select them in the Hierarchy.

- UI Toolkit: Improved the navigation event handling logic for the slider.<br>
    When the slider detects move events aligned with the slider's direction, it adjusts the slider's value. If it detects a navigation submit event, it disables the movable class on the dragger element, causing all navigation events to revert to their default behavior. A second navigation submit event re-enables the class on the dragger and restores the previous customized behavior.
    ([UUM-75128](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cannot-navigate-to-slider-elements-next-to-each-other-horizontally-that-require-tab-key-press-on-keyboard-when-using-a-gamepad-controller))

- UI Toolkit: It is now possible to adjust the MinMaxSliders values using directional navigation. The navigation submit command can be used to toggle between min value adjustment, max value adjustment and focus adjustment modes.
    ([UUM-73854](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/it-is-not-possible-to-move-ui-toolkit-min-slash-max-slider-when-using-a-gamepad-controller))



#### API Changes

- Editor: Deprecated: PlayerSettings.captureSingleScreen.
    (UUM-74786)

- Physics: Added: Fixed 'Reuse Collision Callbacks' behaviour in CharacterController; when on it now prevents garbage generation when using the OnControllerColliderHit callback.
    ([UUM-60515](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/charactercolliders-oncontrollercolliderhit-allocates-80b-of-gc))



#### Changes
