*   Burst: Changes to inliner heuristics to improve build time and reduce executable size.
    
*   Burst: Exception strings no longer contain the entry-point name of the job/function-pointer that caused the throw.

*   Burst: Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 11.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.
    
*   Editor: Deleting an object reference array entry in inspector now removes that array element. Previously first deletion was setting element reference to none, and only the second deletion was deleting the element.

*   Editor: Made importing models with Blendshapes a bit faster if the Import Blendshapes setting is unchecked.
    
*   Editor: Optimized BC7 ("high quality" compression setting on PC/Console platforms) texture compression, now about 2-3 times faster. This is using a new texture compressor (bc7e), added option in Editor Settings to switch to the old one (ISPC) if needed.

*   Graphics: Added Color and Depth Load/Store actions support to the Frame Debugger
    
*   Graphics: Added support for "VFX.CameraBuffersFallback" preferences. It allows to select from 3 options:  
    \-None: Do nothing, keep outdated buffer info from the last rendered frame.  
    \-Prefer Main Camera (Default): Current behavior, use the buffer from Main camera when available, Scene camera otherwise.  
    \-Prefer Scene Camera: Use the buffer from the Scene camera when available, even if the Main camera is being rendered as well.

    *   \[Mobile Platforms\] Initial support to suspending app.
*   License: Sync access token with L-Client upon change
