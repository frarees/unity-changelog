### New 2021.2.0b4 Entries since 2021.2.0b3

#### Features

*   Android: Users can include custom asset packs into the build, by adding assets to the directory ending with '.androidpack'.
    
*   Android: When building Android App Bundle with Split App Binary enabled, Unity will create asset packs.
    

#### Improvements

*   Scripting: The Managed Stripping Level for new projects when targeting the IL2CPP backend will be Minimal.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Using a Texture with invalid settings as a Cursor will now log a warning. (1340519)  
    _First seen in 2021.2.0a20._
    
*   Virtual Texturing: Tile requests are now returned via `PopRequests` more frequently.
    
*   Virtual Texturing: `InvalidateRegion` calls now generate new tile requests in their "importance" order. The importance is defined as a combination of the tile's screen space size and the the number of frames since the tile has been requested. This makes completing tile requests contribute more to the rendering result when `InvalidateRegion` is called continuously.
    

#### API Changes

*   Android: Added: New APIs to manage fast-follow and on-demand delivered asset packs. The APIs wrap Google's PlayCore functionality.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Added new API to replace the use cases of the ShadowAuto, DepthAuto and VideoAuto GraphicsFormat enum members (which will be deprecated in the future).
    

#### Changes

*   Android: Android Gradle Plugin version upgraded from 3.6.0 to 4.0.1.
    
*   Android: Gradle version upgraded from 5.6.4 to 6.1.1.
    
*   Editor: UI widget used for Light Cookies from the standard Property Field to the ObjectField that provides texture preview and asset directory search capabilities, across HDRP and built-in.
    
*   Package: (Recorder) Prevent invalid GPU callback data from being written to a frame: this change skips the problematic frame and logs an error message.
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.6.1
    
*   Virtual Texturing: Now `PopRequests` allows the destination list to have a different size than the texture stack's `maxActiveRequests` value.
    

#### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed Android build failures due to unsupported manifest features when targeting API 23 or below. ([1340517](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-cannot-build-with-target-and-min-sdk-set-to-22))
