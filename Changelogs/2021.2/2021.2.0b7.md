### New 2021.2.0b7 Entries since 2021.2.0b6

#### Improvements

*   IL2CPP: Add full support for System.Reflection.MemberInfo.GetCustomAttributesData
    
*   IL2CPP: Updates IL2CPP to use the new bee distribution format.
    
*   Package: backport com.unity.purchasing.udp@.2.2.2 to 2021.2
    

#### API Changes

*   HDRP: Added: Added a better support for LODs in the ray tracing acceleration structure.
    
*   Shadergraph: Added: Added `Sprite` option to Main Preview, which is similar to `Quad` but does not allow rotation. `Sprite` is used as the default preview for URP Sprite shaders.
    
*   URP: Added: XR: Added Late Latching support to reduce VR latency (Quest).
    

#### Changes

*   Editor: Updated com.unity.cinemachine to 2.8.0
    
*   Graphics: Cubemap pixel access functions (GetPixel/GetPixels/GetPixels32/GetPixelData & SetPixel/SetPixels/SetPixels32/SetPixelData) now throw an ArgumentException when encountering an error.
    
*   Graphics: CubemapArray pixel access functions (GetPixel/GetPixels/GetPixels32/GetPixelData & SetPixel/SetPixels/SetPixels32/SetPixelData) now throw an ArgumentException when encountering an error.
    
*   Graphics: Texture2DArray pixel access functions (GetPixel/GetPixels/GetPixels32/GetPixelData & SetPixel/SetPixels/SetPixels32/SetPixelData) now throw an ArgumentException when encountering an error.
    
*   Graphics: Texture3D pixel access functions (GetPixel/GetPixels/GetPixels32/GetPixelData & SetPixel/SetPixels/SetPixels32/SetPixelData) now throw an ArgumentException when encountering an error.
    
*   Graphics: WebCamTexture pixel access functions (GetPixel/GetPixels/GetPixels32) now throw an ArgumentException when encountering an error. Calling these functions before the first frame update will throw an exception instead of returning blank data.
    
*   HDRP: Moved invariants outside of loop for a minor CPU speedup in the light loop code.
    
*   HDRP: Various improvements to the volumetric clouds.
    
*   Shadergraph: Only ShaderGraph keywords count towards the shader permutation variant limit, SubGraph keywords do not.
    
*   URP: The behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" has changed on mobile. Previously, "Dont Care" would behave identically to "Solid Color" on mobile. Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
