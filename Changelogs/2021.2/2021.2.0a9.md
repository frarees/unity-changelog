#### Improvements

*   Asset Import: Improve import speed for model files containing more than 1 mesh.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved FBX model importing speed.
    
*   Asset Import: Updated Sketchup SDK to version 2020.2.
    
*   Build Pipeline: macOS Standalone player builds will now use a new incremental build pipeline, which allows faster subsequent player builds by only rebuilding parts which have changed.
    
*   Editor: Added profiler markers around test setup, teardown, and execution.
    
*   Editor: Improved import times of SketchUp models (\*.skp).
    
*   Editor: Improving UTF documentation (DSTR-120)
    
*   Editor: Reduce the per-test overhead of running tests in the editor.
    
*   Editor: Reduce time taken by filtering operations when only a subset of tests is run.
    
*   Editor: Reduced the time taken to rebuild the test tree and to scan for assets a test created but did not delete.
    
*   Editor: Sped up loading times for scenes with lots of GameObjects at the top level in the Hierarchy.
    
*   Graphics: Added two new functions in RayTracingAccelerationStructure - UpdateInstanceID and GetInstanceCount. The ray tracing instance ID can be accessed in HLSL code using InstanceID() intrinsic.
    
*   Graphics: Fix comments in shader examples from CommandBuffer.SetRayTracingShaderPass and RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass that point to incorrect functions.
    
*   Graphics: Removed redundant calls when setting shader program parameters.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where using a Git URL with a revision and a package path in the wrong order would still clone the repository, introducing unnecessary delays before failing with an error.
    
*   Package Manager: Improved logging by adding logs for cache misses and tarball download steps.
    
*   Package Manager: Improved the error message when a Git dependency cannot be resolved because the path querystring and revision fragment are in the wrong order.
    
*   Package Manager: Optimized Git package download times for repositories using submodules (with Git 2.28.0 or higher installed only).
    
*   Scripting: CompiliationPipeline.GetAssemblies will now correctly include Roslyn analyzers in ScriptCompilerOptions
    
*   Scripting: Improved runtime performance of many UnityEngine math scripting APIs when using the IL2CPP scripting back-end: Color, Color32, Math, Matrix4x4, Quaternion, Vector2, Vector2Int, Vector3, Vector3Int, Vector4
    
*   Terrain: Terrain brushes that sample empty regions at the edge of a terrain now sampler the nearest terrain's edge. This corrects brush preview off the edge of a terrain, and corrects the bug of melting terrain edges for the following brushes: Smooth Height, Contrast, Sharpen Peaks, Slope Flatten, Hydrolic, Thermal, Wind, Pinch, Smudge and Twist.
