*   Graphics: Platform ShaderLibrary API headers now have a new macro layer for 2d texture sampling macros. This layer starts with PLATFORM\_SAMPLE2D definition, and it gives the possibility of injecting sampling behavior on a render pipeline level. For example: being able to a global mip bias for temporal upscalers.

*   Shadergraph: Changed BranchOnInputNode to choose NotConnected branch when generating Preview.
    
*   Shadergraph: Properties and Keywords are no longer separated by type on the blackboard. Categories allow for any combination of properties and keywords to be grouped together as the user defines.
    
*   Shadergraph: Vector2/Vector3/Vector4 property types will now be properly represented by a matching Vector2/Vector3/Vector4 UI control in the URP + HDRP Material Inspector as opposed to the fallback Vector4 field that was used for any multi-dimensional vector type in the past.
    
*   URP: Changed Pixel Snapping and Upscale Render Texture in the PixelPerfectCamera to a dropdown.
    
*   URP: Improved PixelPerfectCamera UI/UX.

    *   Remove boxing and closure issues on the current implementation of the callback in question
