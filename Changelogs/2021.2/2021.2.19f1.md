#### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed an issue where add PlayCore dependency was added to build.gradle file if it was already added to the project as an .aar file. ([1374774](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-core-libraries-are-not-detected-when-theyre-just-in-the-asset-folder-when-building-app-bundle))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where BuildPlayerOptions.assetBundleManifestPath to be used when building player was not allowed. ([1399616](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buildplayeroptions-dot-assetbundlemanifestpath-can-not-be-set-by-using-buildplayerwindow-dot-registerbuildplayerhandler))
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug when calling profiling `CreateMarker` on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find `CreateMarker__Unmanaged`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a issue where burst was enabled in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler (see changelog entry for 1.6.0-pre.1 for more context around this).
    
*   Burst: Fixed an access violation error that could occur when reading from a static readonly variable.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an exception that could occur if you had the Burst AOT Settings menu docked in the Editor, and then did a player build. Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings).
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where codegen differences could occur when using a local vector variable that was being captured by reference and passed to a called function, versus when it wasn't.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where if there were two generic structs overlapping at the same `FieldOffset` in an explicitly laid out struct, a codegen error would occur.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where if you used `FloatMode.Fast` with `math.pow`, where the `y` argument to `math.pow` was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to `powf` from the cstdlib).
    
*   Burst: Fixed another rare case of the file-is-locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb.
    
*   Burst: Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters.
    
*   Burst: Fixed the Burst `link.xml` output to preserve C# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously.
    
*   Burst: Improved UWP linker error message to clarify which VS components need to be installed for UWP.
    
*   Burst: Made `--burst-force-sync-compilation` command-line option actually work.
    
*   Editor: Fixed a NullReference when showing UnityEvent popup and the GameObject contained a component with a missing script. ([1388739](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unityevent-nullreference-error-is-thrown-when-selecting-a-unityevent-function-for-a-gameobject-that-has-a-missing-script))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed a hang on repeated calls to GraphicsBuffer.CopyCount,. ([1353308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-with-graphicsbuffer-dot-copycount-on-dx11-with-intel-integrated-graphics))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where uniforms in ray tracing hit shaders that were not set by the user would cause wrong uniform values in other hit shaders. ([1407052](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-uniform-issue-for-when-used-for-raytracing-closest-hit-shaders))
    
*   Graphics: Improved to CullScene performance; in large scenes (10000+ Renderers) this can halve the time spent in CullScene. ([1399880](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/culling-dynamic-objects-takes-significantly-longer-in-2019-dot-4-and-above-compared-to-2018-dot-4))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed an issue in which using PlayerSettings.SetAdditionalIl2CppArgs was set to multiple arguments would not work. ([1379270](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-argument-long-plt-is-not-present-in-the-tundra-dot-log-dot-json-log-file-when-the-project-is-built))

*   Mono: Fixed an issue where the mono executable would be run via rosetta instead of natively on apple silicon. ([1379951](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/m1-silicon-editor-intel-mono-processes-are-initialized-when-importing-a-package-into-native-silicon-editor))
    
*   Profiler: Fixed an issue where Custom Profiler categories were not enabled as required by the Profiler window when used in one or more modules.. ([1367356](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profilercountervalue-does-not-appear-in-the-profiler-when-using-custom-category))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed an issue where HLSLcc was not using half precision temps when multiple half precision sample instructions targeted the same temp register. ([1383901](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/fp32-is-used-for-a-temporary-when-compiling-a-shader-for-gles-or-vulkan))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an invisible VisualElement with UsageHints.GroupTransform set would not apply its transform to its visible descendants. ([1402057](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uir-invisible-group-does-not-apply-its-transform-to-its-visible-descendants))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where there was a reduction of GPU performance of the UIToolkit shader. ([1361737](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-uitoolkit-performance-degradation-when-visualelements-are-visible-in-scene))

*   Version Control: Fixed VCCache::instance != NULL error when opening a project with Plastic window opened.
    
*   Web: Fixed an issue where UnityLoader.js macOS string was not updated to match the string SystemInfo.cpp checks against. ([1375632](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shortcuts-with-command-key-on-macos-do-not-work-with-text-input-fields-when-player-is-webgl))
    
*   WebGL: Fixed an issue where there was guarding of "User-Agent" header in UnityWebRequest API. ([1287962](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-user-agent-header-is-not-unguarded-when-using-unitywebrequest))
    
*   WebGL: Fixed an issue where UnityWebRequest redirectLimit for WebGL platform was not implemented. ([1352501](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-request-is-still-redirected-when-setting-unitywebrequest-dot-redirectlimit-to-zero-on-webgl))
