### New 2021.2.0a13 Entries since 2021.2.0a12

#### Features

*   Scene/Game View: EditorToolContext now supports component tools.
    
*   Search: Added search table support to build advanced reports using complex search expressions.
    
*   WebGL: Compressed audio support for WebGL.
    

#### Improvements

*   Android: Added a new Android/Chrome OS player setting, "Chrome OS Input Emulation". If un-checked, this option disables Chrome OS's default behavior of converting mouse and touchpad events into touchscreen events. This allows an app to implement more complete support for these input devices. Also, fixed a bug with Android/Chrome OS touchpad scrolling.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved speed of FBX model importing by skipping unused data.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Windows Standalone player builds will now use a new incremental build pipeline, which allows faster subsequent player builds by only rebuilding parts which have changed.
    
*   Burst: Automatically add \[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)\] to any delegates that are used for BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<>() or error if the delegate has the attribute and it is not Cdecl.
    
*   Documentation: Added a pop-up to Obsolete API labels in the Script Reference, explaining why something is obsolete, and pointing to the new API where possible.
    
*   Editor: Added missing USB device detection and reporting for Linux Editors.
    
*   Editor: Assets in ProjectWindow can now be cut, copied and pasted. (1264821)
    
*   Editor: Inspector property context menu 'Revert to Prefab' works with multiple selected objects now.
    
*   Package: \[UDP\] UI improvements.
    
*   Profiler: Tethered Android devices no longer requires manually calling ADB commands in the CLI, in order to be picked up as connection targets by the Editor. Multiple tethered android devices are now supported.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Improved USS validation to support more complex properties.
    
*   XR: Updated Windows MR Package to 5.2.2.
    

#### API Changes

*   2D: Added: Allow user to register for notification when the SpriteRenderer's Sprite property has changed.
    
*   Graphics: Changed: Renamed Texture2D.Resize to Reinitialize. ([1312670](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture2d-dot-resize-toggles-graphicsformat-each-time-its-called-between-linear-and-srgb))
    
*   UI: Added: Added GetPersistentListenerState to UnityEvent.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added: Tool for converting assets created with the package to use them without the package installation, and to convert them back to package versions.
    

#### Changes

*   2D: 2D Animation Package 6.0.0 as verified package.
    
*   2D: 2D Pixel Perfect 5.0.0 as verified package.
    
*   2D: 2D PSDImporter 5.0.0 as verified package.
    
*   2D: 2D Sprite Shape 6.0.0 as verified package.
    
*   2D: 2D Tilemap Extras 2.0.0 as verified package.

*   Android: Added a new AndroidDevice.hardwareType property, which is set to AndroidHardwareType.ChromeOS if running on a Chrome OS device. This is helpful if an app needs to run Chrome OS-specific code.
    
*   Animation: Fixed animation transition preview playback marker to update correctly when window is floating and animation is paused. ([1285405](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animation-transition-preview-playback-marker-cannot-be-moved-when-the-preview-window-is-floating-and-animation-is-paused))

*   Burst: Fixed multi-CPU dispatcher (used for player builds targetting multiple CPU architectures) generating invalid instructions.
    
*   Editor: Added tooltips in the Scene template Inspector. ([1324637](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-tooltips-are-not-displayed-when-hovering-over-scene-template-properties))
