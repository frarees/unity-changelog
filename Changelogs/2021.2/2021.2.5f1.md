Was OnUpdate() called recursively?`. Instead the system will try to handle the exception and recover into a working state.
    
*   Input System: Fixed "Default constructor not found for type UnityEngine.InputSystem.iOS.LowLevel.iOSStepCounter" any other potential exceptions due to classes, methods, fields and properties being stripped when managed stripping setting set to medium or high.

This fix detects and skips device unpairing and re-pairing if the switch is detected to not be a change to scheme or devices. ([1342297](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-button-clicks-are-missed-when-using-switchcurrentcontrolscheme-inside-of-onmousedown))

([1368559](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/enter-key-is-not-registered-when-using-waspressedthisframe-with-input-system-1-dot-1-1))
    
*   Input System: Generic gamepad short display button names where incorrectly mapped on Switch (`A` instead of `B`, etc).

*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused exceptions to be thrown when using the up/down arrow keys with search list focused. ([1358016](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadergraph-searcher-if-a-user-presses-the-up-or-down-arrow-keys-while-searching-for-nodes-in-sg-an-exception-occurs))
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused incorrect search results with non whitespaced queries for nodes with spaces in their name and for subgraphs. (1359158)
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused search results to not be visible sometimes in the searcher window. (1366061)
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused some searcher items to be irreversibly collapsed due to expand icon disappearing on collapsing those items.
    
*   Shaders: Prevent shader cache from growing infinitely. Shader cache is now organized into per asset folders. ([1339314](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-cache-grows-indefinitely))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the element under pointer was not updated when pointer position varied very slowly (subpixel amounts on each update). ([1356041](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buttons-are-not-registering-mouse-when-the-mouse-is-slowly-moved-over-it))

([1378086](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-produces-visual-studio-project-that-by-default-doesnt-build-when-using-visual-studio-2022))
