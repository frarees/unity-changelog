### New 2021.2.0a11 Entries since 2021.2.0a10

#### Improvements

*   Asset Import: Improved import speed for FBX files that use the ASCII file format.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved model import speed by multithreading mesh triangulation.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved directory enumeration by multi-threading it.
    
*   Build Pipeline: "Scripts Only Build" is now automatic for platforms using the new incremental build pipeline. The checkbox is removed for such platforms, and Unity will automatically detect if it can do a Scripts Only Build based on which changes there are in the project.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Will not ask to save untitled scene if it is not included in the build.
    
*   Editor: Avoid stall entering playmode if a scene contains sequential GameObject file ID hints. ([1308128](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/entering-play-mode-takes-upwards-of-1-hour-when-auto-generating-high-amounts-of-objects))
    
*   Editor: Build Settings window now has texture import overrides, with ability to globally reduce imported texture size and compression settings. This is mostly useful to speed up asset imports & platform switches during development, at expense of texture quality.
    
*   Prefabs: Disabled editing for missing Prefabs instances.
    
*   Profiler: Reworked native connection reporting for the memory profiler in order to properly report connections between assets.
    
*   Scripting: Certificate validation callbacks from .Net libraries pass now also previously identified root certificates along (i.e. the full validated chain if any).
    
*   Scripting: Updated C# language version to 9.0 for compilation and IDE's  
    We will support a subset of the language features from:  
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9  
    These is the features that we support:  
    
    *   Pattern matching enhancements  
        
    *   Function pointers  
        
    *   Target-typed new expressions  
        
    *   Static anonymous functions  
        
    *   Target-typed conditional expressions  
        
    *   Extension GetEnumerator support for foreach loops  
        
    *   Lambda discard parameters  
        
    *   Attributes on local functions  
        
    *   New features for partial methods.
*   XR: Removed "Preview" text from UI display element.

    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue with setting Surface Penetration to 0 on objects that were authored on one scale but used with another. This would manifest itself as incorrect particle separation behavior. ([1319488](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-is-broken-when-parent-gameobject-scale-is-lower-than-1-and-surface-penetration-constraints-are-set-0))

*   Scripting: Instanciation of Unity objects defined in types under more than one level of nesting should work. ([1299861](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/failing-to-initialize-an-instance-of-editorwindow-when-its-in-3rd-level-of-class-nesting))
    
*   Scripting: NativeArray<T>.ReadOnly now implements IEnumerable<T>. ([1319358](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nativearray-dot-readonly-does-not-implement-ienumerable))
    
*   Scripting: Setting Timeout property on a HttpClient object will now correctly propagate the timeout value to any HttpWebRequest objects created by it for async messaging. ([1313205](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/setting-httpclient-dot-timeout-to-a-value-greater-than-the-default-value-of-100-seconds-has-no-effect))

*   UI: Fixed for ScreenPointToWorldPointInRectangle API not returning a valid value when the point is on the plane. which is the case when the canvas plane is on the cameras near plane. ([1313831](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/recttransformutility-functions-with-out-vector-return-only-00-0-when-canvas-sits-exactly-on-the-nearclipplane-of-the-camera))
    
*   UI: Fixed issue where Canvas inspector would update incorrectly as the renderMode is based on the parentCanvas which is null when a Canvas is disabled. This lead to the inspector rendering the wrong options. ([1311169](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-sorting-layer-property-is-displayed-for-the-nested-canvas-when-the-canvas-component-is-disabled))

    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   WebGL: Changed behavior of `Application.OpenURL()` for the WebGL platform to open an URL in a new browser tab instead of opening the URL in the current browser tab and thus navigating away. ([1320393](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/application-dot-openurl-not-working-for-webgl-builds))
