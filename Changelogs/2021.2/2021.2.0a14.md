### New 2021.2.0a14 Entries since 2021.2.0a13

#### Features

*   Android: Added more complete support for running Android apps on the Chrome OS platform. These changes enable building and running Android on x86 and x86-64 CPUs, now officially supported on Chrome OS devices.

#### Improvements

*   Asset Bundles: Added profile marker for CRC checks.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved startup performance for 900,000 file project by 18 seconds.
    
*   Core: Dynamic Heap Allocator now holds on to one empty block to increase performance. ([1272168](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/slower-performance-of-instantiate-when-using-it-in-a-build-compared-to-the-editor))
    
*   Editor: Cached the translation results, reducing GC pressure.
    
*   Editor: Clicking on a Material inside the Renderer component will highlight the Sub Meshes with that Material in the Scene View.
    
*   IMGUI: Improved overall layout and repaint performance.
    
*   macOS: Append to Xcode project now works.
    
*   macOS: When generating Xcode project, it is now possible to pick the build config used for run action (can be changed in Xcode). Debug build config now has frame capture automatically enabled.
    
*   Package: Updated Advertisement package to 3.7.1.
    
*   Package: Updated OpenXR Plugin package to 1.1.1.
    
*   Package: Updated ProBuilder package to 5.0.3.
    
*   Package: Updated WebGL Publisher version to 4.2.2.
    
*   Physics: Improved Articulation Body anchor limit gizmos.
    
*   Scripting: Ensure players using the Mono scripting runtime backend always use a JIT (Just-In-Time) friendly set of class libraries, even if the ".NET Standard 2.0" API Compatibility Level is chosen. This provides consistency for Mono players no matter what API Compatibility Level is chosen in the player settings.
    
*   Scripting: Improved runtime performance of many UnityEngine math scripting APIs when using the Mono scripting back-end: Matrix4x4, Quaternion, Vector2, Vector2Int, Vector3, Vector3Int, Vector4.
    

#### API Changes

*   GI: Added: Allow to opt out of automatic ambient probe and default reflection probe generation.
    
*   Graphics: Added: ScriptableRenderContext.SubmitForRenderPassValidation added to validate whether RenderPass API calls inside the context are eligible for execution.
    
*   Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.maxGraphicsBufferSize added for querying the maximum size of a Mesh/Graphics/Compute buffer. Creating larger ones now also throws exceptions (previously was often just crashing). ([1319589](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-crashes-when-creating-a-large-mesh-tested-with-180-000-000-vertices-with-a-script), [1319594](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/untitled-7))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Deprecated: CurveField.borderUssClassName and GradientField.borderUssClassName are now deprecated since the related visual element is not required to render a border anymore.
    

#### Changes

*   Graphics: Modified VirtualTexturing resolver to always resize to the requested width and height.
    
*   UI Toolkit: URLs in UXML and USS files now support explicit GUID-based asset references. This allows assets referenced by UI assets to be renamed or moved within your project without breaking asset references. The UI Builder saves both UXML and USS files using this format. Note that this URL format is backward-compatible, but the URL query parameters are ignored in older Unity versions.
    

#### Fixes

*   Android: Added fullscreen flag to manifest to better handle static splash screen. ([1310347](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/custom-static-image-for-splash-screen-moves-on-android-build-when-loading))
