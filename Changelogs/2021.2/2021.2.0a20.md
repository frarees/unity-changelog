### New 2021.2.0a20 Entries since 2021.2.0a19

#### Features

*   2D: New template to allow users to start a new project with 2D Renderer setup.
    
*   Package: (Recorder) Added support for arm64 macOS.
    
*   Physics: Added a new CustomCollider2D that allows custom 2D physics shapes to be used providing a complete customizable and fully featured 2D Collider.
    
*   Physics: Added Physics Profiler counters to the list of available counters in the Profiler Module editor window.
    
*   Physics: Added the ability to read low-level 2D physics shapes (PhysicsShape2D) from any 2D Collider into a new shape container (PhysicsShapeGroup2D).
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added transitions properties to UI Toolkit.
    

#### Improvements

*   2D: Prerelease SpriteShape and PSDImporter package for 2021.2.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added a new UI in the AssetImporter inspectors that display all AssetPostprocessors methods that were used in the last import of the selected asset.
    
*   Audio: AudioMixer did not perform equal power panning for group attenuations when transitioning between snapshots. A new transition type "Attenuation" has been added. (1322673)
    
*   Core: Reduced number of memory alllocations and improved tracking of core allocations.

#### Changes

*   Asset Pipeline: AssetPostprocessors calls are now ordered by their GetPostprocessOrder and then by their FullName (namespace.classname).  
    It was not ordered by FullName before so some call orders between AssetPostprocessors with the same GetPostprocessOrder value may have changed.
    
*   Editor: Moved some main toolbar elements to the left align container.
    
*   Package: com.unity.purchasing updated to 3.2.1. Please refer to the package changelog online here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.purchasing@3.2/changelog/CHANGELOG.html.
