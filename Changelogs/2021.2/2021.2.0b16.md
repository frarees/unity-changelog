*   Asset Pipeline: Support for importing models and textures in parallel in external processes (off by default, enable in Project Settings -> Editor -> Refresh.
    
*   Burst: Added a new optimization mode, `Balanced`. This is now the default optimization mode, and trades off slightly lower maximum performance for much faster compile times.
    
*   Burst: Added an `OptimizeFor` option to `[BurstCompile]`, allowing users to specify whether they want to prioritize runtime speed, runtime size, or compilation time.
    
*   Burst: Added Embedded Linux as a new target platform for Burst.

*   Burst: Added warnings about delegates being used by `BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer` that are not decorated as expected. In most cases, Burst will automatically add the C-declaration attribute in IL Post Processing, but if the usage of CompileFunctionPointer is abstracted away behind an open generic implementation, then Burst will not be able to automatically correct the delegate declaration, and thus this warning will be displayed.
    
*   Burst: Added workarounds for issues where Windows Native Debuggers restrict the number of messages and DLLs that can be sent to the debugger when attaching.
    
*   Burst: Apple silicon support.

Local, any player that is running local to the machine, this includes devices connected via cable. Remote any player that is running anywhere else on the network that is reachable. Direct connection, this is for connecting directly via IP address or any player that has automatically connected. There options are further searchable using the new search bar.  
    Any connections to players which exist from before this feature will still appear though they will appear under the category of "Connection Without Id".  
    Further to this there no exists an option that can be used to supply a custom connection name for the profiler which will make it easier for the user to find their desired connection.

    Shaders, compute shaders and materials now operate in separate local keyword spaces. All keywords declared in a shader or in a compute shader using any of the multi\_compile\* or shader\_feature\* directives are local. Material and Compute Shader classes now operate with local keywords only.  
    Global keyword space contains global keywords. Global keywords are converted to local keyword space of a shader or compute shader prior to rendering. When a shader or a compute shader declares a keyword that has the same name as a global keyword, turning this global keyword on or off will affect variant selection.
    
*   Terrain: Added a new instancing mode for Terrain details, which uses the material specified on the prototype prefab to render detail objects with instanced draws.
    
*   Terrain: Added the _Terrain Tools package 4.0.0-pre.2_ to the pre-release set.

#### Improvements

*   2D: Added folder support for SpriteAtlas V2 in 2D.
    
*   2D: Cache internal reflection to speed up Sprite editing data access.
    
*   2D: Improved performance for setting multiple Tiles on a Tilemap.
    
*   2D: Improved performance of RuleTile caching.
    
*   2D: Improved performance when importing large number of textures.
    
*   2D: Improved the placement of Tiles generated from Sprites with Textures sliced using the Isometric Slicing option in the Sprite Editor.
    
*   2D: Prereleased the SpriteShape and PSDImporter package
    
*   2D: Updated icons for the Tile Palette Rotate and Flip tools.
    
*   2D: Updated the 2D template to use the latest verified 2D packages.
    
*   2D: Updated the 2D URP template starting folder structure for better clarification of usage.
    
*   2D: Updated the Skinning Editor tooltips text.
    
*   AI: Added the `RasterizeModifierBox` profiler marker for the NavMesh builder step that processes ModifierBox sources.
    
*   Android: Added a new Android/Chrome OS player setting, "Chrome OS Input Emulation". If un-checked, this option disables Chrome OS's default behavior of converting mouse and touchpad events into touchscreen events. This allows an app to implement more complete support for these input devices. Also, fixed a bug with Android/Chrome OS touchpad scrolling.
    
*   Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch `platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold`. This specifies which CPU cores to treat as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.
    
*   Android: Added support for custom cursors to Android to support Player Settings and C# functions on Android version 7.0 and later.
    
*   Android: Allow low-level configuration of Unity threads (priority, affinity)
    
*   Android: Changed the device scanning operation of the Android Extension to be async when receiving an USB device changed event. ([1349380](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/opening-project-which-doesnt-target-android-stall-for-a-few-seconds-with-scanning-for-usb-devices))
    
*   Android: If a hardware keyboard is available, Unity now uses it within UI systems, instead of always bringing up a virtual, on-screen keyboard.
    
*   Android: Made a large part of the Android Build Pipeline incremental which means sequential builds with zero changes are now much faster. That also means Unity no longer creates builds from scratch, but instead updates the files which dependencies have changed. If you use the IPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject callback, note that it might be operating on files which were modified by IPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject from a previous build.
    
*   Android: Unity gradle projects now have a new entry in gradle.properties, unityTemplateVersion. Unity increments this property whenever Unity gradle template files change. That way if you build on top of the old folder and the unityTemplateVersion is different, Unity throws an error, saying that you need to update your gradle files or build to an empty folder.
    
*   Android: Updated Android Logcat package to 1.2.3.
    
*   Android: When generating manifest files, there are new files in Library\\Bee\\artifacts\\Android\\Manifest, LibraryManifestDiag.txt, LauncherManifestDiag.txt. They contain information about why a specific permission is added to manifest.
    
*   Asset Bundles: Added profile marker for CRC checks.
    
*   Asset Import: Documented the `MonoImporter` class.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved FBX model importing speed.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import performance of ASCII FBX files.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import performance of FBX files.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed for FBX files that use the ASCII file format.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed for model files containing more than 1 mesh.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed of FBX models by skipping unused data.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed of models that contain multiple meshes.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved import speed of Sketchup models.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved model import speed by multithreading mesh triangulation.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved model import times for models that contain animations.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved Model Importer material tab display performance. (1295743)
    
*   Asset Import: Improved model importing performance for files that contain lots of curves.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved the model import times slightly for models that contain animations.
    
*   Asset Import: Increased the speed of Asset Import when using mikktspace tangent generation on meshes containing degenerate triangles.
    
*   Asset Import: Optimized texture import mipmap calculation when Kaiser filtering is used (e.g. importing 16GB of textures with mostly Kaiser mip filters goes from 127 sec down to 109 sec).
    
*   Asset Import: Reduced peak memory usage during Model Importing.
    
*   Asset Import: Updated Sketchup SDK to version 2020.2.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added a new UI in the AssetImporter inspectors that display all AssetPostprocessors methods that were used in the last import of the selected asset.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added summary in the editor log about what happened during a refresh (import).
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added warnings and an _Automatic Fix_ button where main object names do not match the corresponding filename.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved directory enumeration by multi-threading it.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved project startup times. Projects with 900,000 files will load at least 30 seconds faster.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved speed of Editor startup by fixing Asset handling related code.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved startup performance for 900,000 file project by 18 seconds.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved upload and download path
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Optimized the UnityEngine.Hash128.ToString method.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: The Asset Pipeline no longer displays a warning when it is not possible to move import worker log files.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Unity prefetches Asset Databases to improve Editor startup time and reduce cost of page faults.
    
*   Audio: Added a new _Attenuation_ transition type to AudioMixer so that it can perform equal power panning for group attenuations when transitioning between snapshots. (1322673)
    
*   Audio: Added voice priority display in the audio pane of profiler.
    
*   Audio: Added VU metering information from audio mixer groups in the audio pane of profiler to make it easier to compare it against volume and audibility levels.
    
*   Audio: Improved the way audio mixers are displayed inside the audio profiler pane when the "Groups" and "Channels and Groups" view modes are enabled.  
    Previously the column-based sorting from the "Channels" view mode was applied to the other view modes too which resulted in inconsistent ordering of channels and groups below mixers and even mixers changing order dynamically, making the profiler hard to read.  
    Additionally the names of the mixers is now shown in the profiler where it currently only showed the ambiguous "Master" groups of the mixers below the "Audio Listener" group.  
    Finally the triangle shape after the titles of the column headers in the Detailed and Clip views was changed to an arrow that more clearly indicates the sorting order, and the arrow is now placed before the title instead of after it to avoid cutting it off when the columns are manually resized to fit the window.
    
*   Audio: Target mixer groups are now displayed in the audio profiler.
    
*   Bug Reporter: The Crash Handler window now includes the following UI changes:  
    
    *   _Stack trace_ field  
        
    *   _Go to crash logs_ button  
        
    *   _Report a Bug…_ button  
        
    *   _Open Unity Hub_ button  
        Note that clicking the _Open Unity Hub_ button restarts the Editor.
*   Build Pipeline: "Scripts Only Build" is now automatic for platforms using the new incremental build pipeline. The checkbox is removed for such platforms, and Unity will automatically detect if it can do a Scripts Only Build based on which changes there are in the project.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Changed Linux so that it uses the incremental player build pipeline.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Improved linking speed for big projects
    
*   Build Pipeline: Improved the performance of the build pipeline by giving concurrent shader cache folders read access.
    
*   Build Pipeline: MacOS Standalone player builds now use the new incremental build pipeline, which allows faster subsequent player builds by only rebuilding parts which have changed.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Modified Windows Standalone player builds so that they only rebuild parts that have changed since the previous build to improve build speed.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Removed prompt to save an untitled scene if it is not included in the build.
    
*   Build Pipeline: WebGL now uses the incremental Player build pipeline.
    
*   Burst: Automatically add \[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)\] to any delegates that are used for BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<>() or error if the delegate has the attribute and it is not Cdecl.
    
*   Burst: Improved codegen.
    
*   Core: Modified the Dynamic Heap Allocator to reduce the time it takes to intantiate chunks in a Build. ([1272168](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/slower-performance-of-instantiate-when-using-it-in-a-build-compared-to-the-editor))
    
*   Core: Reduced the number of memory alllocations and improved the tracking of core allocations.

*   Search: Use a single Search Provider to search for any indexed object.
    
*   Serialization: Improved the way that `SerializeReference` handles missing types. Instances where the type is missing are replaced with `null`. Other instances are editable and if there are fields that previously referred to the missing type which are still null, the missing type is preserved.
    
*   Serialization: Objects referenced from `SerializeReference` fields now have stable IDs, which reduces the risk of conflicts when multiple users collaborate on a scene file. Additionally, it also improves support for Undo and Prefab modes, especially when `SerializeReference` is used inside arrays and lists. In addition, references now come with a new format with backward compatibility support for older assets.

*   Terrain: Terrain brushes that sample empty regions at the edge of a terrain now sample the nearest terrain's edge. This corrects brush preview off the edge of a terrain, and corrects the bug of melting terrain edges for the following brushes: Smooth Height, Contrast, Sharpen Peaks, Slope Flatten, Hydrolic, Thermal, Wind, Pinch, Smudge and Twist.
    
*   Tests: Improved the logging in iOS automation so that existing log messages are clarified, and added new ones.
    
*   UI: Added a visualization for the raycast padding around a Graphic object.

*   UI Toolkit: Modified TransitionEvents to be collapsed when relevant.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Set UIDocument's execution order to -100 to ensure root visual element is created when user's OnEnable runs.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Usage hints can now be changed on a `VisualElement` without having to remove it from the hierarchy to help preserve styling and layout.
    
*   Undo System: Explorable undo history UI.
    
*   Version Control: Added Checkin and Update confirmation notification.
    
*   Version Control: Improved load time performance.
    
*   Version Control: Made stability and performance improvements to the Version Control package (com.unity.collab-proxy).
    
*   Video: Improved the automatic selection of target material texture properties in VideoPlayer. It detects \[MainTexture\] attributes, then detects them by the \_MainTex naming convention.
    
*   Virtual Texturing: Tile requests are now returned via `PopRequests` more frequently.
    
*   Virtual Texturing: `InvalidateRegion` calls now generate new tile requests in their "importance" order. The importance is defined as a combination of the tile's screen space size and the the number of frames since the tile has been requested. This makes completing tile requests contribute more to the rendering result when `InvalidateRegion` is called continuously.
    
*   Web: Updated UnityWebRequest's libCurl backend (used on most platforms).
    
*   WebGL: Added support for Screen Orientation Locking and Auto-Rotating for mobile browsers which supports the Screen Orientation API.
    
*   WebGL: Refactored `unityInstance.Quit()` in UnityLoader.js and `call QuitCleanup` from both `unityInstance.Quit()` and `Application.Quit()`.
    
*   WebGL: Updated WebGL compiler to Emscripten 2.0.19 and removed support for the obsolete asm.js linker target.

*   GI: Added: Allow to opt out of automatic ambient probe and default reflection probe generation.
    
*   GI: Added: LightingSettings.lightmapCompression has been added and determines the quality of compression used for lightmaps.
    
*   GI: Deprecated: LightmapSettings.textureCompression has been deprecated in favor of LightingSettings.lightmapCompression.
    
*   Graphics: Added: "Expand/Collapse All" buttons to Rendering Debugger window menu.
    
*   Graphics: Added: A new API for compiling shaders from editor code and obtaining reflection info was added to ShaderData.Pass.

*   Graphics: Added: RenderTexture.depthStencilFormat and RenderTextureDescriptor.depthStencilFormat properties. You can now set the exact Depth/Stencil buffer format on a RenderTexture using the depthStencilFormat property. Before, each platform backend would decide what format is used without any control or visibility. The existing APIs that take a number of depth bits will still select the same format as before on each backend. When upgrading RenderTexture assets from an older project, all Depth/Stencil buffers that had more than 16bits will be converted to D24\_UNorm\_S8\_UInt. On high end platforms, this could result in 24bits for depth instead of 32bits resulting in visual artifacts. You need to change the Depth/Stencil format on the RenderTexture asset if that is the case.

*   URP: Made 2D shadow casting more efficient.
    
*   URP: Modified the behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" on mobile. "Dont Care" now fills the render target with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which might be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should only use "Dont care" if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
    
*   URP: Moved all 2D APIs out of the experimental namespace.
    
*   URP: Refactored some of the array resizing code around decal projector rendering to use new APIs in render core.
