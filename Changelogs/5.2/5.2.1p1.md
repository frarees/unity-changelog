*   (none) - UI: Added clear function to vertex helper.
*   (none) - UI: Big fixes to GC pressure. We were non optimally creating garbage in the UI system when we should not have been.
*   (710495) - UI: Do not render elements with an alpha == 0 or color.a == 0.

*   (none) - UI: Fixed performance regression in the UI system caused by accessing a mesh repeatedly. Fix is to use the UI helper class and only finalize to mesh as the last step.

Both code paths work, but the new one is faster if you are using effects.
*   ([718250](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/canvas-dot-pixelrect-crashes-unity)) - UI: Return the correct Canvas rectangle when using nested canvases. We were returning the incorrect Canvas rectangle previously.
