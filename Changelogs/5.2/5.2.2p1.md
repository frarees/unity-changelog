### Features

*   iOS: Added a PlayerSetting to add the iOS 9 UIRequiresFullScreen to the Xcode generated plist to enable/disable multitasking support.
*   iOS: Added Touch Pressure support. Scripts can access this API through the pressure and maximumPossiblePressure properties on Touch.

### Improvements

*   Networking: Added log messages to identify the object and script that cause too-large packets to be generated.
*   Networking: Added more logging info on too-large packets when object state updates exceed the MTU.
*   Unity Ads: Update to Unity Ads 1.5.3
*   VR: A camera can now target the main display backbuffer in VR mode by setting "Target Eye" to "None (Main Display)".
