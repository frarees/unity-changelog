### Improvements

*   GI: Added the "Ignore Normals" option on the MeshRenderer to skip comparing normals when detecting charts for realtime GI. This can be necessary when using hand authored UVs to avoid chart splits.
*   GI: Added the "Min Chart Size" option on the MeshRenderer to allow for lowering chart size in case stiching is not needed.
*   VR: Updated the OVRPlugin. Oculus Runtime 0.8 is required to use Oculus VR with this patch.
