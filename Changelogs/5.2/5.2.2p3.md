### Improvements

*   IL2CPP: Allow null checks, array bounds checks, and divide by zero checks to be selectively included or omitted from generated C++ code by using a C# attribute on type, method, or property definitions.
*   iOS/IL2CPP: Enable incremental build support using the "Append" option. Keep the generated code stable across additional, removal, and changes for string literals and non-generic types.
*   ([587995](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2d-collider-is-rendered-differently-than-it-appears-when-you-try-to-edit-it))Physics: Always render the outline of a PolygonCollider2D in dark-green so that if an edge is discarded, it still shows.
*   ([718508](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/overlaparea-collider-isnt-detected-in-some-positions)) - Physics: Increase precision of Physics2D.OverlapArea & Physics2D.OverlapCircle methods.

### Fixes

*   (740573) - FrameDebugger: Fixed draw call count jumping when there were realtime probes in the scene.
*   (733772) - IL2CPP: Convert assemblies that are mentioned in a link.xml file but are not referenced by any other assemblies at compile time.
*   ([718885](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-socket-i-slash-o-hanging-with-il2cpp)) - IL2CPP: Prevent an intermittent hang with asynchronous sockets.
*   (739935) - iOS: Added build & run support for Xcode 7.1.
*   (723360) - iOS: Export correct image for iPad launch screen now,
*   (none) - iOS: Fixed incorrect landscape launch orientation on iPad.
*   (none) - iOS: Fixed minor launch screen placement issue on devices with large resolution screens.
*   (732806) - iOS: Fixed occasional 1-frame glitches in dynamic font rendering.
*   (none) - iOS: Fixed second-stage splashscreen on some devices with iOS 6 and 7.

*   (none) - iOS: Fixed legacy launch screens on iOS 9.1.
*   ([738778](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-sorting-by-distance-broken)) - Particles: Fixed sorting by distance.
*   ([712007](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hingjoint2d-dot-jointangle-can-be-calculated-incorectly-causing-wound-up-joints)) - Physics: HingeJoint2D no longer produces incorrect reference angles from Rigidbody2D angles.
*   ([719418](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/istouchinglayers-returns-true-when-not-touching)) - Physics: Physics2D, Collider2D & Rigidbody2D IsTouching and IsTouchingLayers now correctly represents Box2D contact state.
*   ([727734](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/boxcast-and-circlecast-return-imprecise-data)) - Physics: Physics2D.CircleCastXXX and Physics2D.BoxCastXXX now correctly detect very fractional overlaps.
*   (713391) - WSA: Fixed: Can't build & run to SDK 8.1 if only VS2015 is installed.
