### Features

*   iOS: iOS9 app slicing support.
*   iOS: iOS9 on demand resource support.

### Improvements

*   Android: On some devices Screen.dpi returns more accurate values.
*   Editor: Added progress bar while decrypting downloaded Asset Store packages.
*   Graphics: Added overloads to CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget() to allow specifying a target mip level and cubemap face.
*   Improved ETC1 based policy for grouping of sprites on an atlas.
*   iOS: Added frameworks new in iOS 8.0 to 9.0 to the plugin importer UI.
*   iOS: Added support for iPad launch screens
*   iOS: Exposed option in Player Settings to temporary disable Application Transport Security checks in iOS 9.0.
*   iOS: Now support access to iOS9 data assets within asset catalogs via virtual filesystem.

*   VR: Oculus: Upgraded to 0.7 dependencies.

### Changes

*   iOS: Use launch screens as primary source for splash images.
*   VR: For Windows Oculus Development, the Oculus 0.7.0.0 runtime is required in order to run in VR mode. Future releases will also require this runtime going forward.
