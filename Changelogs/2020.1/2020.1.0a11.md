#### API Changes

The functions are `StartAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)`, `StopAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)`, `InAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)` and `SamplePlayableGraph(PlayableGraph graph, int index, float time)`.
    
*   Asset Import: Add: Added 'IgnorePNGGamma' getter and setter to TextureImporter
    
*   Asset Import: Add: Adds AssetDatabase.ImportPackageItemsCallback to provide information about what UnityPackage contents were selected by the user for import.

*   Editor: Change: Modifiy the order of Scene View `OnSceneGUI` callbacks to invoke the active Editor Tool prior to the View Tool controls. This allows tools to override the alt key, right mouse button, and middle mouse button shortcuts.
    
*   Editor: Remove: `EditorSnapSettings.active`, `EditorSnapSettings.enabled`, and `EditorSnapSettings.preferGrid` are removed. Use `EditorSnapSettings.gridSnapEnabled` instead.
    
*   Graphics: Add: Add SetComputeBufferCounterValue & SetComputeBufferData command to Rendering.CommandBuffer
    
*   Graphics: Add: Added MeshRenderer.enlightenVertexStream for Realtime GI UV mesh access. The Realtime GI system doesn't modify additionalVertexStreams any more. ([1148742](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/baking-lightmap-erases-existing-additional-vertex-streams))
    
*   Graphics: Add: Exposed the default read, gray and linearGray texture objects via `Textur2D.red`, `Texture2D.gray` and `Texture2D.linearGray` properties.
    
*   Graphics: Add: Moved shader properties APIs from UnityEditor.ShaderUtils to UnityEngine.Shader therefore made them available in players. These APIs are:

    *   GetPropertyCount
    *   GetPropertyDefaultFloatValue
    *   GetPropertyDefaultVectorValue

*   Scripting: Add: Added new API for specifying preprocessor defines for player only assemblies - Build.Player.ScriptCompilationSettings.extraScriptingDefines, BuildPlayerOptions.extraScriptingDefines. Previously you would need to use PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup, but that causes recompilation of Editor scripts, which is not what you would want, when specifying defines only for assemblies used by player.
    
*   UI Elements: Deprecate: VisualTreeAsset.CloneTree() will be deprecated in favor of VisualTreeAsset.Instantiate().

*   Android: When exporting a gradle proejct, il2cpp generated native files will be also copied to gradle project, the il2cpp library will be compiled/linked via gradle. Previously il2cpp library was being precompiled/prelinked by Unity when exporting project. This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline.

This can speed up workflows, particularly when wanting to apply or revert everything except a few items. ([1106861](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/selecting-multiple-prefab-overrides-plus-clicking-apply-does-not-apply-all-selected-overrides))

*   Version Control: Added 'strip' command to YAMLMerge that can generate a new file with only the differences between the first two
    
*   Version Control: Inspector import settings Apply button now only checks out the .meta file. For non-Unity assets (images, meshes etc.), Check Out only checks out .meta, and Open checks out the asset. Open button is now enabled for non-checked out assets too. ([1162487](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vcs-modifying-texture-import-settings-also-checks-out-the-asset-itself-in-perforce-not-only-the-meta-file))
    
*   Web: UnityWebRequest: Add support for data uploading using GET method. ([1183281](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unitywebrequest-sends-incorrect-content-length-when-uploading-data-using-the-get-method))
