*   Scripting Upgrade: Fixed to avoid checking VCS if only the files outside /assets folder need updating. (1217542)
    
*   Serialization: Ensured that globalgamemanagers.assets is deterministic. ([1269880](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/globalgamemanagers-dot-assets-file-is-not-deterministic-when-comparing-two-builds-of-the-same-project))
    
*   Serialization: Fixed error "Expect ':' between key and value within mapping" when extra spaces were found at the end of a block mapping. ([1268628](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-parser-failure-error-is-thrown-after-importing-a-specific-animation-file-to-a-unity-project))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed Burst not working in ExecutableOnly builds. ([1271694](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uwp-lib-burst-generated-dot-dll-gets-placed-in-the-wrong-folder-for-executableonly-builds-making-it-unable-to-be-loaded))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed bursted code falling back to non-burst path. ([1271195](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/burst-fails-to-load-at-runtime-on-uwp))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed plugin .pdb files not getting packaged into .appxsym package when creating a build to be uploaded to the Windows Store.

*   XR: Reduced unnecessary Vulkan backbuffer allocations. (1275149)
    

#### Changes

*   Package Manager: Package com.unity.purchasing updated to 2.1.0.
    
*   XR: Updated Oculus XR Plugin package to 1.4.3.
    

#### Improvements

*   Editor: Updated to ProBuilder 4.4.0.
    
*   GI: Changed AMD board names shown in the Lighting window to GPU device dropdown instead of gfx901, gfx1010 etc.
    
*   Package Manager: Upgraded Cinemachine to 2.6.1.
    
*   Profiler: Load icon changed to more clearly read as "Load".
    
*   XR: Changed XR Statistics to cache thread-safe stats that only get promoted to 'live' data after a render pass. However a number of data points need to be 'initialized' before we actually render a frame (like Frame Rate).
    

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK
    

##### For running Unity games

Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
    
*   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities
    
*   Exported Android Gradle projects require Android Studio 3.4 and later to build
