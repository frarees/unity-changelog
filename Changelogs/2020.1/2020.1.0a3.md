#### Improvements

*   Android: Add OpenGL ES support of FrameTimingManager API.
    
*   Android: Added support for Android Library projects, created using current Android Studio, as plugins.
    
*   Android: Improve error messages for cases where android application fails to load libmain.so. Previously it was printing "Unable to find main", now it will print "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", additionally it will print exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed info, where the application was looking for libmain.so
    
*   Animation: Added functions to HumanPoseHandler in order to get and set joint transforms.
    
*   Asset Import: Added 'IgnorePNGGamma' setting to the textureImporter. (1172234)

*   Editor: Improved sharpness and clarity of scene view Gizmo textures when they are far away.
    
*   Editor: Tweaked the PlayerSettings for XboxOne: in DX12 mode : mark graphics jobs as enabled (even though the tickbox is disabled). For DX12/DX11 mode : mark the graphics jobs mode UI control as disabled.
    
*   GI: Compressed transparency textures for GPU lightmapper, 75% memory reduction for transparency textures by using rgba32 instead of floats.
    
*   GI: GPU lightmapper can now write out the filtered AO texture to disk, alongside the Lighting Data Asset. Only available in On Demand mode. Only available through experimental API.
    
*   Graphics: Optimised Cluster Rendering networking
    
*   Graphics: Texture loading now faster when quality setting set to reduced texture quality.
    
*   macOS: Pen devices are now supported under the new input system on the mac platform
    
*   Package Manager: Added diagnostic check to Package Manager Diagnostics that starts Unity Package Manager and sends a request to its health check endpoint.

*   Shaders: Added new surface shader pragma "nocolormask" to prevent auto-generating ColorMask. This way user can override the ColorMask with their own. ([1174789](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-override-colormask-in-a-surface-shader-with-an-alpha-pragma-directive))
    
*   UI Elements: Added attribute "type" to ObjectField uxml attributes. This allows for specifying a type and associated Assembly. For example `".` If you are unsure of the type string to use, you can use typeof(MyType).AssemblyQualifiedName to get the full string. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname?view=netframework-4.8
    
*   UI Elements: Added UxmlTypeAttributeDescription. Provides the ability to provide types and assemblies as an attribute in uxml.

*   XR: Added a V2 signing option to the Oculus Android settings that should be used when building for Quest, and disabled when building for Go and GearVR.
    

#### API Changes

*   Asset Import: Added 'IgnorePNGGamma' getter and setter to TextureImporter

*   Physics: Replace "Physics2D.AutoSimulation" with "Physics2D.SimulationMode".
    
*   Scripting: Expose the built-in function 'PlatformSpecificOpenFileAtLine' ([1173165](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-a-new-script-is-not-being-opened-as-a-different-tab-when-using-vscode))
