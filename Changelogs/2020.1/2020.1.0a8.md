#### API Changes

*   Graphics: Add SetComputeBufferCounterValue & SetComputeBufferData command to Rendering.CommandBuffer
    
*   Scripting: Added new API for specifying preprocessor defines for player only assemblies - Build.Player.ScriptCompilationSettings.extraScriptingDefines, BuildPlayerOptions.extraScriptingDefines.

*   2D: Allow Gizmos from OnDrawGizmos to be shown in the Tile Palette
    
*   Android: Conversion between C# and Java arrays of matching types is much faster (up to 2 orders of magnitude for large arrays).
    
*   Scripting: Improved icons for the validity of Define Constraints in the Asmdef Importer Inspector.  
    _This has been backported and will not be mentioned in final notes._

*   Web: UnityWebRequest: the new result property will tell if request is completed successfully or what kind of failure occurred. DownloadHandler class also has new property error, which will give descriptive message if a failure occurred when processing received data.
    

#### Features

*   Asset Import: Increased to maximum texture import resolution to 16384
    
*   Graphics: Add HDR display support for Vulkan on Windows

#### API Changes

*   Asset Import: Added 'IgnorePNGGamma' getter and setter to TextureImporter
    
*   Asset Import: Adds AssetDatabase.ImportPackageItemsCallback to provide information about what UnityPackage contents were selected by the user for import.
    
*   Editor: Added EditorUtility.ClearDirty, tells Unity not to save asset to disk after performing changes to an asset
    
*   Editor: Exposing user display name on UnityConnect object.
    
*   Editor: Make ApplyUSS and FromUSS public
    
*   Editor: Modifiy the order of Scene View `OnSceneGUI` callbacks to invoke the active Editor Tool prior to the View Tool controls. This allows tools to override the alt key, right mouse button, and middle mouse button shortcuts.
    
*   Editor: `EditorSnapSettings.active`, `EditorSnapSettings.enabled`, and `EditorSnapSettings.preferGrid` are removed. Use `EditorSnapSettings.gridSnapEnabled` instead.
    
*   Graphics: Add SetComputeBufferCounterValue & SetComputeBufferData command to Rendering.CommandBuffer
    
*   Graphics: Added MeshRenderer.enlightenVertexStream for Realtime GI UV mesh access. The Realtime GI system doesn't modify additionalVertexStreams any more. ([1148742](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/baking-lightmap-erases-existing-additional-vertex-streams))
    
*   Graphics: Exposed the default read, gray and linearGray texture objects via `Textur2D.red`, `Texture2D.gray` and `Texture2D.linearGray` properties.
    
*   Graphics: Moved shader properties APIs from UnityEditor.ShaderUtils to UnityEngine.Shader therefore made them available in players. These APIs are:
    
    *   FindPropertyIndex
    *   GetPropertyAttributes
    *   GetPropertyCount
    *   GetPropertyDefaultFloatValue
    *   GetPropertyDefaultVectorValue
    *   GetPropertyDescription
    *   GetPropertyFlags
    *   GetPropertyName
    *   GetPropertyRangeLimits
    *   GetPropertyTextureDefaultName
    *   GetPropertyTextureDimension
    *   GetPropertyType
*   Physics: Add "Physics2D.SimulationMode" to allow selection of three simulations modes: FixedUpdate, Update or Script.
    
*   Physics: Replace "Physics2D.AutoSimulation" with "Physics2D.SimulationMode".
    
*   Scripting: Added new API for specifying preprocessor defines for player only assemblies - Build.Player.ScriptCompilationSettings.extraScriptingDefines, BuildPlayerOptions.extraScriptingDefines. Previously you would need to use PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup, but that causes recompilation of Editor scripts, which is not what you would want, when specifying defines only for assemblies used by player.
    
*   UI Elements: Remove borderColor property from IStyle and IResolvedStyle
