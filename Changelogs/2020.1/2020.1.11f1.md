### 2020.1.11f1 Release Notes

#### System Requirements Changes

##### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

#### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed error when exporting Gradle project that contains .aar files to the same location. ([1246663](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-export-aar-file-more-than-once-in-an-android-project))

([1181701](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-simulation-is-not-natural-when-time-scale-is-changed-from-one-thats-close-to-zero-to-1))
