*   Graphics: Removed unused argument for UnityEditor.LightEditor/Settings::DrawRange
    

#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   2D: Rename Can Change Z Position to Lock Z Position for Brush Inspector in Tile Palette

#### Improvements

Previously il2cpp library was being precompiled/prelinked by Unity when exporting project. This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline. Note: If you don't export a project, il2cpp library will be linked by Unity as it was before.

    _This has been backported and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Version Control: Inspector import settings Apply button now only checks out the .meta file. For non-Unity assets (images, meshes etc.), Check Out only checks out .meta, and Open checks out the asset. Open button is now enabled for non-checked out assets too. ([1162487](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vcs-modifying-texture-import-settings-also-checks-out-the-asset-itself-in-perforce-not-only-the-meta-file))

*   Animation: Migrated class AnimationModeDriver to public API.
    
*   Animation: Migrated several functions in AnimationMode to public API. The functions are `StartAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)`, `StopAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)`, `InAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)` and `SamplePlayableGraph(PlayableGraph graph, int index, float time)`.
    
*   Asset Import: Added 'IgnorePNGGamma' getter and setter to TextureImporter
    
*   Asset Import: Adds AssetDatabase.ImportPackageItemsCallback to provide information about what UnityPackage contents were selected by the user for import.
    
*   Editor: Added EditorUtility.ClearDirty, tells Unity not to save asset to disk after performing changes to an asset
    
*   Editor: Exposing user display name on UnityConnect object.
    
*   Editor: Make ApplyUSS and FromUSS public
    
*   Editor: Modifiy the order of Scene View `OnSceneGUI` callbacks to invoke the active Editor Tool prior to the View Tool controls. This allows tools to override the alt key, right mouse button, and middle mouse button shortcuts.
    
*   Editor: `EditorSnapSettings.active`, `EditorSnapSettings.enabled`, and `EditorSnapSettings.preferGrid` are removed. Use `EditorSnapSettings.gridSnapEnabled` instead.
    
*   Graphics: Add SetComputeBufferCounterValue & SetComputeBufferData command to Rendering.CommandBuffer
    
*   Graphics: Added MeshRenderer.enlightenVertexStream for Realtime GI UV mesh access. The Realtime GI system doesn't modify additionalVertexStreams any more. ([1148742](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/baking-lightmap-erases-existing-additional-vertex-streams))
    
*   Graphics: Exposed the default read, gray and linearGray texture objects via `Textur2D.red`, `Texture2D.gray` and `Texture2D.linearGray` properties.
    
*   Graphics: Moved shader properties APIs from UnityEditor.ShaderUtils to UnityEngine.Shader therefore made them available in players. These APIs are:
    
    *   FindPropertyIndex
    *   GetPropertyAttributes
    *   GetPropertyCount
    *   GetPropertyDefaultFloatValue
    *   GetPropertyDefaultVectorValue
    *   GetPropertyDescription
    *   GetPropertyFlags
    *   GetPropertyName
    *   GetPropertyRangeLimits
    *   GetPropertyTextureDefaultName
    *   GetPropertyTextureDimension
    *   GetPropertyType

*   Physics: Add "Physics2D.SimulationMode" to allow selection of three simulations modes: FixedUpdate, Update or Script.
    
*   Physics: Replace "Physics2D.AutoSimulation" with "Physics2D.SimulationMode".
    
*   Scripting: Added new API for specifying preprocessor defines for player only assemblies - Build.Player.ScriptCompilationSettings.extraScriptingDefines, BuildPlayerOptions.extraScriptingDefines. Previously you would need to use PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup, but that causes recompilation of Editor scripts, which is not what you would want, when specifying defines only for assemblies used by player.
    
*   UI Elements: Remove borderColor property from IStyle and IResolvedStyle
    
*   UI Elements: VisualTreeAsset.CloneTree() will be deprecated in favor of VisualTreeAsset.Instantiate().
    
*   UI Elements: `Button.onClick` is now obsolete. Use `Button.clicked` instead.
    
*   Version Control: Deprecated MergeMethod C# enum, it never did anything useful.
    

#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

#### Improvements

*   2D: Allow GameObjects to be shown in the Tile Palette
    
*   2D: Allow Gizmos from OnDrawGizmos to be shown in the Tile Palette
    
*   Android: Add OpenGL ES support of FrameTimingManager API.
    
*   Android: Add support for GL\_EXT\_texture\_compression\_astc\_decode\_mode
    
*   Android: Added support for Android Library projects, created using current Android Studio, as plugins.
    
*   Android: Avoid redundant framebuffer restores when using Vulkan
    
*   Android: Conversion between C# and Java arrays of matching types is much faster (up to 2 orders of magnitude for large arrays).
    
*   Android: Enable support for RenderTextureFormat.RGB111110Float when using Vulkan on Adreno
    
*   Android: Improve error messages for cases where android application fails to load libmain.so. Previously it was printing "Unable to find main", now it will print "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", additionally it will print exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed info, where the application was looking for libmain.so
    
*   Android: When exporting a gradle proejct, il2cpp generated native files will be also copied to gradle project, the il2cpp library will be compiled/linked via gradle. Previously il2cpp library was being precompiled/prelinked by Unity when exporting project. This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline. Note: If you don't export a project, il2cpp library will be linked by Unity as it was before.

*   Scripting: The serializer can now serialize fields of generic types (e.g. MyClass<int> someField) directly; it is no longer necessary to derive a concrete subclass from a generic type in order to serialize it.
    
*   UI Elements: <Style> can now appear as a direct child of <UXML>
    
*   UI Elements: <Template> can now appear anywhere in the doc, as long as it is before the <Instance> tag referring to them.
    
*   UI Elements: Added attribute "type" to ObjectField uxml attributes. This allows for specifying a type and associated Assembly. For example `".` If you are unsure of the type string to use, you can use typeof(MyType).AssemblyQualifiedName to get the full string. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname?view=netframework-4.8
