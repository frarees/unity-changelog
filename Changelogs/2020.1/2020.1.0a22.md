*   Android: Dynamic resolution when using Vulkan now only supports scale factors in 5% steps to improve performance when switching resolution.
    
*   Editor: C# compiler warnings are no longer emitted for readonly packages.
    
*   Editor: JIRA: https://unity3d.atlassian.net/browse/EC-692  
    This is an iteration over the Progress bar API, which has not been released to the public yet.
    
*   Editor: Tree component is not preset-able anymore.
    
*   Editor: Unity projects now have "UserSettings" top-level folder, EditorUserSettings.asset moved from Library there ([960774](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/p4-credentials-are-lost-when-cleaning-the-library-folder))
    
*   Editor: When a compile error is emitted for an assembly, clear all compile errors for all assemblies that reference it directly or directly. This improves workflows when dealing with compile errors, as fixing an assembly's compile errors might also fix compile errors in any assemblies that reference the assembly directly or indirectly.
    
*   Editor: When opening a new Project Browser use the list view by default (instead of icon view) as this gives the best overview of asset names
    
*   GI: Increased minimum specification for GPU lightmapper to 4 GB of video memory.

*   Multiplayer: The unet multiplayer hlapi package is no longer automatically added to older projects opened in the editor. This now needs to be manually added with the Package Manager.
    
*   Package Manager: Adding Verified status to Cinemachine, and updated minimum version
    
*   Profiler: Renamed profiler marker Material.SetPassUncached to Material.SetPassCacheMissed
    
*   Scripting: Incremental GC is now enabled by default for new projects
    
*   Shaders: When running with -nographics, shaders will now treat all of their subshaders as 'not supported.' This means that in -nographics environments, APIs like Shader.isSupported will return false, and also that shaders should consume much less memory because they will no longer keep all the unusable compiled shader code in memory.
    
*   Timeline: Creating a new Timeline will no longer automatically add an Animation Track and an Animator to the target GameObject.
    
*   Timeline: Ease-in and ease-out values for clips are no longer restricted to 50% of the clip's duration.
    
*   Version Control: Moved VCS settings to a separate panel under Edit/Project Settings. ([1184063](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vcs-perforce-slash-etc-settings-could-really-use-a-separate-entry-in-project-settings-sidebar))
    
*   Version Control: Removed "Host" (P4HOST) setting from Perforce plugin UI

*   Android: Expand uncaught exception information. Added additional information when uncaught exception is thrown. Previously it would print Unity version, Device model, Device fingerprint.

This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline. Note: If you don't export a project, il2cpp library will be linked by Unity as it was before.

*   Physics: Add a new component ArticulationBody that helps to create articulations. An articulation is a set of bodies, some of which have their relative motion constrained. All bodies are organized in a logical tree, where parent-child relation expresses the constrained motion. Unlike regular Rigidbodies with Joints, articulations are solved with a different solver (Featherstone) in reduced coordinates which guarantees there will never be any stretch of locked degrees of freedom. Typical examples of articulations include robotic arms, ragdolls, etc.

    *   Faster shader compilation.  
        
    *   Accurate include dependency tracking.  
        
    *   "#pragma" directives can now be inside preprocessor conditional blocks, but only when those conditions do not depend on keywords originating from other "#pragma" directives or from project settings.  
        
    *   Supports "#pragma once" and "#pragma warning" directives.  
        
    *   Follows the C standard more closely.  
        
    *   The new shader preprocessor is _disabled by default_. It can be enabled via a command-line option "-force-new-shader-pp".  
        
    *   The new preprocessor is not yet used for Compute or Raytracing shaders.
*   Shaders: Shader inspector now has an option to show preprocessed shader source instead of compiled shader source. _Requires new shader preprocessor_.
    
*   Timeline: Inline Curve Properties can be removed.
    
*   Timeline: The resize handle for inline curves has been moved to the track header area.
    
*   Timeline: Tracks can be individually resized.
