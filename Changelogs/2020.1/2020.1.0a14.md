#### API Changes

*   GI: Added: Added new LightingSettings and moved over all settings there. Marked the old as deprecated.
    
*   GI: Deprecated: Marked LightmapEditorSettings and Lightmapping APIs as deprecated, and replaced them with LightingSettings.
    
*   Package Manager: Removed: Removed support for the deprecated exclude project dependency keyword
    

#### Changes

*   Editor: When a compile error is emitted for an assembly, clear all compile errors for all assemblies that reference it directly or directly. This improves workflows when dealing with compile errors, as fixing an assembly's compile errors might also fix compile errors in any assemblies that reference the assembly directly or indirectly.

#### Improvements

*   Asset Import: Optimized shader import times using asynchronous compilation for error checking.
    
*   Editor: New API for Stage handling. See StageUtililty's: GetCurrentStage(), GetMainStage() and GetStage(GameObject). Also added API for finding components in a Stage: See Stage's FindComponentsOfType().  
    _This is a change to a 2020.1 change, not seen in any released version, and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    

#### Features

*   GI: Added all lightmap settings as an asset. This will allow the user to share them between scenes or switch them out in an easy way. Icon and inspector is still missing.
    
*   Graphics: Added HDROutputSettings script interface to retrieve information from an HDR display and to allow for custom color space conversion and tonemapping when working with HDR displays
    
*   iOS: Added Sparse Texture support
    
*   Particles: Abiltiy to save and restore Particle System state data, making it possible to save a snapshot of an entire Particle System at a point in time. A use case for this is for efficient rewind support, by saving periodic keyframes of the particle state, to avoid full resimulations.
    
*   Services: The Services Window is refactored to remove the usage of CEF.
    
    *   Uses UIElements for UI
    *   All the configurations are available in the Project Settings window
    *   The deprecated Multiplayer service has been removed.
*   Version Control: Add ability to set version control Editor Settings from the CLI.

*   Editor: Changed: Modifiy the order of Scene View `OnSceneGUI` callbacks to invoke the active Editor Tool prior to the View Tool controls. This allows tools to override the alt key, right mouse button, and middle mouse button shortcuts.
    
*   Editor: Removed: `EditorSnapSettings.active`, `EditorSnapSettings.enabled`, and `EditorSnapSettings.preferGrid` are removed. Use `EditorSnapSettings.gridSnapEnabled` instead.

*   Scripting: Added: Added new API for specifying preprocessor defines for player only assemblies - Build.Player.ScriptCompilationSettings.extraScriptingDefines, BuildPlayerOptions.extraScriptingDefines. Previously you would need to use PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup, but that causes recompilation of Editor scripts, which is not what you would want, when specifying defines only for assemblies used by player.
    
*   UI Elements: Deprecated: VisualTreeAsset.CloneTree() will be deprecated in favor of VisualTreeAsset.Instantiate().

*   Editor: When a compile error is emitted for an assembly, clear all compile errors for all assemblies that reference it directly or directly. This improves workflows when dealing with compile errors, as fixing an assembly's compile errors might also fix compile errors in any assemblies that reference the assembly directly or indirectly.
    
*   GI: Making Enlighten fully deprecated when using a SRP that doesn't support it.
    
*   GI: The `Prioritize view` checkbox in the Lighting window is now `Progressive updates`. In non-progressive mode lightmaps are composited once they are fully converged.

*   iOS: Made iOS 11 minimum support iOS version
    
*   iOS: Removed Armv7 (32 bit) support
    
*   Scripting: Incremental GC is now enabled by default for new projects

([1122023](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/terrain-not-visible-when-loaded-from-asset-bundle-and-has-draw-instanced-enabled))
    
*   Timeline: Creating a new Timeline will no longer automatically add an Animation Track and an Animator to the target GameObject.

*   2D: Allow GameObjects to be shown in the Tile Palette
    
*   2D: Allow Gizmos from OnDrawGizmos to be shown in the Tile Palette
    
*   Android: Add OpenGL ES support of FrameTimingManager API.
    
*   Android: Add support for GL\_EXT\_texture\_compression\_astc\_decode\_mode
    
*   Android: Added support for Android Library projects, created using current Android Studio, as plugins.
    
*   Android: Avoid redundant framebuffer restores when using Vulkan

*   Android: Enable support for RenderTextureFormat.RGB111110Float when using Vulkan on Adreno
    
*   Android: Expand uncaught exception information. Added additional information when uncaught exception is thrown. Previously it would print Unity version, Device model, Device fingerprint. Now it will also print - Build Type, Scripting Backend, ABI, Strip Engine Code value. Note: In Android 8, google no longer allows to embed additional information for uncaught exceptions, thus this change will be visible on Android 7.0 or lower.
    
*   Android: Improve error messages for cases where android application fails to load libmain.so. Previously it was printing "Unable to find main", now it will print "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", additionally it will print exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed info, where the application was looking for libmain.so
    
*   Android: When exporting a gradle proejct, il2cpp generated native files will be also copied to gradle project, the il2cpp library will be compiled/linked via gradle. Previously il2cpp library was being precompiled/prelinked by Unity when exporting project. This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline. Note: If you don't export a project, il2cpp library will be linked by Unity as it was before.

*   Prefabs: The Overrides dropdown buttons "Revert All" and "Apply All" now change to "Revert Selected" and "Apply Selected" when multiple override items are selected. This can speed up workflows, particularly when wanting to apply or revert everything except a few items. ([1101411](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/improved-prefabs-is-is-possible-to-revert-removed-component-without-having-its-dependency-on-gameobject), [1106861](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/selecting-multiple-prefab-overrides-plus-clicking-apply-does-not-apply-all-selected-overrides))

For example `".` If you are unsure of the type string to use, you can use typeof(MyType).AssemblyQualifiedName to get the full string. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname?view=netframework-4.8
    
*   UI Elements: Added UxmlTypeAttributeDescription. Provides the ability to provide types and assemblies as an attribute in uxml.
