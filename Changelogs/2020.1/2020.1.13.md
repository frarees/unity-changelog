#### API Changes

-   Physics: Added: Added writeable WheelCollider.sprungMass, to enable explicit mass distributions. In addition to that, exposed WheelCollider.ResetSprungMasses() to reset the vehicle back to automatically calculated implicit sprung masses. It uses the same usage pattern as with Rigidbody.inertiaTensor / Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor().

#### Improvements

-   2D: Improved performance of TilemapRenderer Individual mode.

-   Profiler: Added progress bar when loading and saving Profiler data.
