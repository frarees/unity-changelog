#### Features

*   Asset Import: Added analytics tracking for asset importers settings, assetPostProcessor usage and Authoring DCC for 3D model assets.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added AssetDatabase.DisallowAutoRefresh and AssetDatabase.AllowAutoRefresh to the C# API.
    
*   Editor: Add a button in the Grid and Snap Settings to move the grid to the active handle position.
    
*   Editor: Added a collapsable version of SceneView Overlays
    
*   GI: Add an experimental explicit baking API for probe related data.

*   Graphics: Add support for Virtual Texturing to the Editor and Player
    
*   Graphics: Added support for Skinned Mesh Renderer in Ray Tracing
    
*   Physics: Add a new component ArticulationBody that helps to create articulations. An articulation is a set of bodies, some of which have their relative motion constrained. All bodies are organized in a logical tree, where parent-child relation expresses the constrained motion. Unlike regular Rigidbodies with Joints, articulations are solved with a different solver (Featherstone) in reduced coordinates which guarantees there will never be any stretch of locked degrees of freedom. Typical examples of articulations include robotic arms, ragdolls, etc.
    
*   Profiler: CustomSampler and Recorder API have been extended to GPU. Use gpuElapsedNanoseconds and gpuSampleBlockCount to get GPU metrics at runtime on the final player device. ( you can use supportsGpuRecorder graphics caps flag to check platform support )
    
*   Shaders: New shader preprocessor (experimental).
    
    *   Faster shader compilation.
    *   Accurate include dependency tracking.
    *   "#pragma" directives can now be inside preprocessor conditional blocks, but only when those conditions do not depend on keywords originating from other "#pragma" directives or from project settings.
    *   Supports "#pragma once" and "#pragma warning" directives.
    *   Follows the C standard more closely.
    *   The new shader preprocessor is _disabled by default_. It can be enabled via a command-line option "-force-new-shader-pp".
    *   The new preprocessor is not yet used for Compute or Raytracing shaders.
*   Shaders: Shader inspector now has an option to show preprocessed shader source instead of compiled shader source. _Requires new shader preprocessor_.

#### Changes

*   2D: Rename Can Change Z Position to Lock Z Position for Brush Inspector in Tile Palette

*   Editor: When a compile error is emitted for an assembly, clear all compile errors for all assemblies that reference it directly or directly. This improves workflows when dealing with compile errors, as fixing an assembly's compile errors might also fix compile errors in any assemblies that reference the assembly directly or indirectly.
    
*   Editor: When opening a new Project Browser use the list view by default (instead of icon view) as this gives the best overview of asset names
    
*   GI: Making Enlighten fully deprecated when using a SRP that doesn't support it.
    
*   GI: The `Prioritize view` checkbox in the Lighting window is now `Progressive updates`. In non-progressive mode lightmaps are composited once they are fully converged.
    
*   Graphics: Implement stencil binding support for Vulkan
    
*   iOS: Made iOS 11 minimum support iOS version
    
*   iOS: Removed Armv7 (32 bit) support

*   Android: Expand uncaught exception information. Added additional information when uncaught exception is thrown. Previously it would print Unity version, Device model, Device fingerprint. Now it will also print - Build Type, Scripting Backend, ABI, Strip Engine Code value. Note: In Android 8, google no longer allows to embed additional information for uncaught exceptions, thus this change will be visible on Android 7.0 or lower.
    
*   Android: Improve error messages for cases where android application fails to load libmain.so. Previously it was printing "Unable to find main", now it will print "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", additionally it will print exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed info, where the application was looking for libmain.so
    
*   Android: When exporting a gradle proejct, il2cpp generated native files will be also copied to gradle project, the il2cpp library will be compiled/linked via gradle. Previously il2cpp library was being precompiled/prelinked by Unity when exporting project. This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline. Note: If you don't export a project, il2cpp library will be linked by Unity as it was before.

*   Prefabs: The Overrides dropdown buttons "Revert All" and "Apply All" now change to "Revert Selected" and "Apply Selected" when multiple override items are selected. This can speed up workflows, particularly when wanting to apply or revert everything except a few items. ([1101411](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/improved-prefabs-is-is-possible-to-revert-removed-component-without-having-its-dependency-on-gameobject), [1106861](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/selecting-multiple-prefab-overrides-plus-clicking-apply-does-not-apply-all-selected-overrides))

*   Version Control: Inspector import settings Apply button now only checks out the .meta file. For non-Unity assets (images, meshes etc.), Check Out only checks out .meta, and Open checks out the asset. Open button is now enabled for non-checked out assets too. ([1162487](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vcs-modifying-texture-import-settings-also-checks-out-the-asset-itself-in-perforce-not-only-the-meta-file))

*   iOS: Added Sparse Texture support
    
*   Linux: Added support IL2CPP scripting backend support for Linux Standalone player
    
*   Package Manager: Adds UX support for UPM package format hosted on Asset Store

*   Package Manager: Shows reverse dependencies of a package in the package manager window.
    
*   Particles: Abiltiy to save and restore Particle System state data, making it possible to save a snapshot of an entire Particle System at a point in time. A use case for this is for efficient rewind support, by saving periodic keyframes of the particle state, to avoid full resimulations.
    
*   Particles: Lifetime by Emitter Speed Module, for controlling how long-lived particles are based on the speed of the emitter at the time they were emitted. This is for instance useful for moving fire.  
    Image: https://i.imgur.com/TKKULBj.gif  
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/TKKULBj.gif)
    
*   Particles: New Freeform Stretching mode where particles don't look squashed when viewed head-on, and where particle rotation is independent from stretching direction.  
    Image: https://i.imgur.com/7D4bPUx.gif  
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/7D4bPUx.gif)
    
*   Physics: Add a new component ArticulationBody that helps to create articulations. An articulation is a set of bodies, some of which have their relative motion constrained. All bodies are organized in a logical tree, where parent-child relation expresses the constrained motion. Unlike regular Rigidbodies with Joints, articulations are solved with a different solver (Featherstone) in reduced coordinates which guarantees there will never be any stretch of locked degrees of freedom. Typical examples of articulations include robotic arms, ragdolls, etc.
    
*   Profiler: CustomSampler and Recorder API have been extended to GPU. Use gpuElapsedNanoseconds and gpuSampleBlockCount to get GPU metrics at runtime on the final player device. ( you can use supportsGpuRecorder graphics caps flag to check platform support )

*   Shaders: New shader preprocessor (experimental).
    
    *   Faster shader compilation.
    *   Accurate include dependency tracking.
    *   "#pragma" directives can now be inside preprocessor conditional blocks, but only when those conditions do not depend on keywords originating from other "#pragma" directives or from project settings.
    *   Supports "#pragma once" and "#pragma warning" directives.
    *   Follows the C standard more closely.
    *   The new shader preprocessor is _disabled by default_. It can be enabled via a command-line option "-force-new-shader-pp".
    *   The new preprocessor is not yet used for Compute or Raytracing shaders.
*   Shaders: Shader inspector now has an option to show preprocessed shader source instead of compiled shader source. _Requires new shader preprocessor_.
    
*   Timeline: Inline Curve Properties can be removed.
    
*   Timeline: The resize handle for inline curves has been moved to the track header area.
    
*   Timeline: Tracks can be individually resized.
