*   Profiler: Added: Added RawFrameDataView API for the fast allocation free access to Profiler data in the Editor.
    

#### Changes

*   Android: Android Library Project plugins now require to be directories with .androidlib "extension"; can be place anywhere inside Unity project.
    
*   Editor: Skip OnDestroy/Awake callbacks when resetting ExecuteInEditMode scripts when entering Play Mode with scene reload disabled (1191938)

#### Improvements

*   2D: Add Tilemap InsertCells/DeleteCells API to insert rows, columns and layers of cells to a Tilemap
    
*   Android: Expand uncaught exception information. Added additional information when uncaught exception is thrown. Previously it would print Unity version, Device model, Device fingerprint.

The functions are `StartAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)`, `StopAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)`, `InAnimationMode(AnimationModeDriver driver)` and `SamplePlayableGraph(PlayableGraph graph, int index, float time)`.
    
*   Asset Import: Added: Added 'IgnorePNGGamma' getter and setter to TextureImporter
    
*   Asset Import: Added: Adds AssetDatabase.ImportPackageItemsCallback to provide information about what UnityPackage contents were selected by the user for import.
    
*   Editor: Added: Added EditorUtility.ClearDirty, tells Unity not to save asset to disk after performing changes to an asset
    
*   Editor: Added: Exposing user display name on UnityConnect object.
    
*   Editor: Added: Make ApplyUSS and FromUSS public
    
*   Editor: Changed: Modifiy the order of Scene View `OnSceneGUI` callbacks to invoke the active Editor Tool prior to the View Tool controls. This allows tools to override the alt key, right mouse button, and middle mouse button shortcuts.
    
*   Editor: Removed: `EditorSnapSettings.active`, `EditorSnapSettings.enabled`, and `EditorSnapSettings.preferGrid` are removed. Use `EditorSnapSettings.gridSnapEnabled` instead.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Add SetComputeBufferCounterValue & SetComputeBufferData command to Rendering.CommandBuffer
    
*   Graphics: Added: Added MeshRenderer.enlightenVertexStream for Realtime GI UV mesh access. The Realtime GI system doesn't modify additionalVertexStreams any more. ([1148742](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/baking-lightmap-erases-existing-additional-vertex-streams))
    
*   Graphics: Added: Exposed the default read, gray and linearGray texture objects via `Textur2D.red`, `Texture2D.gray` and `Texture2D.linearGray` properties.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Moved shader properties APIs from UnityEditor.ShaderUtils to UnityEngine.Shader therefore made them available in players. These APIs are:
    
    *   FindPropertyIndex
    *   GetPropertyAttributes
    *   GetPropertyCount
    *   GetPropertyDefaultFloatValue
    *   GetPropertyDefaultVectorValue
    *   GetPropertyDescription
    *   GetPropertyFlags
    *   GetPropertyName
    *   GetPropertyRangeLimits

    *   GetPropertyTextureDimension
    *   GetPropertyType

Previously you would need to use PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup, but that causes recompilation of Editor scripts, which is not what you would want, when specifying defines only for assemblies used by player.
    
*   UI Elements: Deprecated: VisualTreeAsset.CloneTree() will be deprecated in favor of VisualTreeAsset.Instantiate().
    
*   UI Elements: Obsoleted: `Button.onClick` is now obsolete. Use `Button.clicked` instead.

*   Android: Enable support for RenderTextureFormat.RGB111110Float when using Vulkan on Adreno
    
*   Android: Expand uncaught exception information. Added additional information when uncaught exception is thrown. Previously it would print Unity version, Device model, Device fingerprint. Now it will also print - Build Type, Scripting Backend, ABI, Strip Engine Code value. Note: In Android 8, google no longer allows to embed additional information for uncaught exceptions, thus this change will be visible on Android 7.0 or lower.
    
*   Android: Improve error messages for cases where android application fails to load libmain.so. Previously it was printing "Unable to find main", now it will print "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", additionally it will print exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed info, where the application was looking for libmain.so
    
*   Android: When exporting a gradle proejct, il2cpp generated native files will be also copied to gradle project, the il2cpp library will be compiled/linked via gradle. Previously il2cpp library was being precompiled/prelinked by Unity when exporting project. This improvement gives you an ability to both debug and profile il2cpp files when needed, it also increases your control over the build pipeline. Note: If you don't export a project, il2cpp library will be linked by Unity as it was before.
