*   Editor: When a compile error is emitted for an assembly, clear all compile errors for all assemblies that reference it directly or directly. This improves workflows when dealing with compile errors, as fixing an assembly's compile errors might also fix compile errors in any assemblies that reference the assembly directly or indirectly.
    
*   Editor: When opening a new Project Browser use the list view by default (instead of icon view) as this gives the best overview of asset names
    
*   GI: Making Enlighten fully deprecated when using a SRP that doesn't support it.

*   Android: Expand uncaught exception information. Added additional information when uncaught exception is thrown. Previously it would print Unity version, Device model, Device fingerprint. Now it will also print - Build Type, Scripting Backend, ABI, Strip Engine Code value. Note: In Android 8, google no longer allows to embed additional information for uncaught exceptions, thus this change will be visible on Android 7.0 or lower.
    
*   Android: Improve error messages for cases where android application fails to load libmain.so. Previously it was printing "Unable to find main", now it will print "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", additionally it will print exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed info, where the application was looking for libmain.so
    
*   Android: When exporting a gradle proejct, il2cpp generated native files will be also copied to gradle project, the il2cpp library will be compiled/linked via gradle.

    *   Supports "#pragma once" and "#pragma warning" directives.
    *   Follows the C standard more closely.
    *   The new shader preprocessor is _disabled by default_. It can be enabled via a command-line option "-force-new-shader-pp".
    *   The new preprocessor is not yet used for Compute or Raytracing shaders.
*   Shaders: Shader inspector now has an option to show preprocessed shader source instead of compiled shader source. _Requires new shader preprocessor_.
    
*   Timeline: Inline Curve Properties can be removed.
    
*   Timeline: The resize handle for inline curves has been moved to the track header area.
    
*   Timeline: Tracks can be individually resized.
    
*   UI Elements: Ability to use touch in scrollview, in runtime only
    
*   Version Control: Add ability to set version control Editor Settings from the CLI.
    
*   WebGL: Updated WebGL loader which improves build loading time and supports build-specific stripping of the loader code.
    

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)
