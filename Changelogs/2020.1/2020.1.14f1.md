([1269403](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-player-crashes-with-litenetbugmain-when-accessing-ipinterfaceproperties-dot-gatewayaddresses))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed unnecessary box call in generic code when using enums. ([1271254](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-unsafeutility-methods-generate-garbage-when-using-il2cpp-scripting-backend))
    
*   IL2CPP: Removed unnecessary assertions that are triggered incorrectly in WebGL debug builds. ([1165055](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-build-throws-threads-are-not-enabled-for-this-platform-error-when-programs-built-using-debug-c-plus-plus-compiler-configuration))
    
*   iOS: Added iPad Pro 4th Generation and iPad Pro 11" 2nd Generation to DeviceGeneration. ([1280059](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-device-dot-generation-returns-deviceunknown-with-some-devices))

*   Package Manager: Fixed the Packager Manager to no longer fail to write the project manifest file (`Packages/manifest.json`) or the lock file (`Packages/packages-lock.json`) when they are read-only. ([1263361](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-manager-doesnt-ask-if-manifest-dot-json-and-packages-lock-dot-json-files-should-be-made-writable-when-opening-a-project))

([1265836](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/component-variables-label-text-is-not-bolded-when-editing-prefabs-rigidbody2d-constraints))
    
*   Physics: Fixed to ensure that changing the Rigidbody2D mass distribution correctly adjusts the center of mass velocity. (1272075)
    
*   Physics: Fixed to ensure the 2D per-frame SimulationMode2D correctly runs the simulation after the Update script callback and not before it to match FixedUpdate script callback. ([1274820](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/update-method-is-called-before-any-physics-2d-callbacks-when-simulation-mode-property-is-set-to-update))

*   Prefabs: Fixed that Prefab is marked dirty when cancelling the 'Create new prefab' and 'Create new Variant' dialogs while in Prefab Mode. ([1285301](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cancelling-the-create-new-prefab-and-create-new-variant-dialogs-while-in-prefab-mode-dirties-the-prefab))

*   Profiler: Fixed an issue where FrameCount inside the ProfilerUserSettings would clamp to a 0 - 2000 frame range instead of 300 - 2000, thus causing the charts inside the ProfilerWindow to throw out of range exceptions. (1288878)
    
*   Profiler: Fixed CPU Module Detailed view sorting when search field is active. ([1214785](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-profiler-entries-arent-sorted-when-using-search-filter-and-sorting-by-column))

*   Profiler: Fixed scroll wheel to now work on the scroll bars in the profiler timeline view. ([1280335](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-timeline-view-scroll-bars-are-not-interactive-when-the-mouse-cursor-is-in-the-scroll-bar-field))

*   SceneManager: Fixed GetManagerFromContext crash when unloading a Scene while loading another Scene asynchronously with allowSceneActivation = false. ([1092438](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/getmanagerfromcontext-crash-when-unloading-a-scene-while-loading-another-scene-asynchronously))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed generic mono array overwrite in bindings code. ([1268308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mono-arraytypemismatchexception-is-thrown-when-using-list-of-generic-icollection))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed issue where thread statics that reused thread static slots would not adhere to type alignment. This would cause the garbage collector to incorrectly clean up thread static data because it would only scan pointer aligned memory for references. This would lead to memory becoming corrupted and inducing random crashes. ([1266322](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mono-class-fill-runtime-generic-context-when-entering-play-mode-repeatedly))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed files not enabling Adreno framebuffer fetch extension. ([1269926](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inout-parameter-is-only-valid-in-shader-files-but-not-valid-in-cginc-files))

*   UI: Fixed Canvas RectTransform size calculation to be done for standalone renders as well. Camera needs to be enabled to pick up the RenderTexture size change. ([833456](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/canvas-dot-forceupdatecanvases-doesnt-update-canvas-before-camera-dot-render-is-called))
    
*   UI: Fixed OnDrop callback not being called when using a TouchScreen. ([1279352](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mobile-ondrop-function-is-not-called-when-using-a-touchscreen))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added EditorWindow.CreateGUI entry point to safely add visual elements to the window. (1281376)
    
*   WebGL: Fixed a bug with compressed single channel textures attempting to target unsupported BC4 compression format. ([1274662](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-settings-are-automatically-set-to-use-unsupported-format-when-the-texture-has-certain-settings-set))
    
*   WebGL: Fixed DST time computation for locales that have changed their DST behavior since year 2000. (e.g. Lithuania). ([1179945](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-datetime-dot-tolocaltime-does-not-convert-to-local-time-in-build-when-using-chrome-slash-firefox-slash-opera-browsers))
    
*   Windows: Fixed crashes in PhraseRecognizer when mic disconnected. ([1268538](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-stackwalker-getcurrentcallstack-when-calling-grammarrecognizer-dot-stop-after-diconnecting-a-microphone))
    
*   XR: Fixed to utilize volume up and down buttons on VR devices to confirm and proceed when Android dialog is not visible on VR devices instead of only restricting to click "Ok" button on screen. ([1140155](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/oculus-go-managed-debugger-dialog-cannot-be-interacted-with-when-launching-the-application))
    

#### Changes

*   Burst: Changed to temporarily remove the Burst compiler warning about exception throws not in \[Conditional("ENABLE\_UNITY\_COLLECTIONS\_CHECKS")\] methods, to let us address user feedback. The next minor version of Burst will reincorporate this in a more friendly manner.

#### Improvements

*   Android: Improved scuh that in the case of incomplete application install, where native libraries are missing, a dialog will be shown where app can be gracefully quit. Previous behaviour was an application crash in com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer.<clinit>, java.lang.System.loadLibrary functions. (1281533)
    
*   IL2CPP: Improved error message when required Visual Studio components are not installed when building for Windows.
    

#### System Requirements
