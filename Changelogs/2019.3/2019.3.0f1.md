#### Changes

*   2D: The 2D template is updated to version 3.2.5.
    
*   2D: Version 3.2.3 of the 2D template.
    
*   Android: Improved error messages for cases where an Android application fails to load libmain.so. Unity now prints "Failed to load 'libmain.so', the application will terminate.", and an exception from System.loadLibrary with detailed information about where the application was looking for libmain.so.
    
*   Android: Minimum supported Android version is now Android 4.4 KitKat (API 19)
    
*   Android: The option to target x86 for Android has now been removed.
    
*   Android: Updated Android NDK used to version r19.
    
*   Apple TV: Removed support for Universal Harmony Remote, currently there's no way to properly support Universal Harmony Remote without breaking Siri Remote.
    
*   Asset Import: Added a warning when Unity imports multiple sub-Assets with the same name or type. This often happens when importing Models with multiple Meshes or Materials that have the same name in the .fbx file. Their resulting fileID (and thus references to them) may break or change if Unity finds a new sub-Asset with the same name before the existing one after re-importing.
    
*   Editor: The Preset Manager now supports a list of default Presets for each Preset type instead of a single Preset. The default Preset contains a filter that is tested against the new default Object to determine whether or not to apply the Preset to the Object. Every matching Preset is applied, in order, to the new default Object, regardless of whether it was created using the ObjectFactory API or an importer.
    
*   GI: Deprecated Enlighten, and hid it from new Projects in Scriptable Render Pipelnes. Upgraded Projects will still show it.
    
*   Graphics: Adding explicit depth resolve to RenderPass Metal

*   Graphics: Version 4.2.2 of the 3D template.
    
*   Package Manager: Moved the **Create + Develop** feature from out of this version of the Package Manager UI. This will be available in a future release of Unity.
    
*   Scripting: Incremental GC is now no longer marked as "Experimental"
    
*   Timeline: Enabled rectangle tool for inline curves.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Removed icons that were only used on Windows 8.1 apps from Player Settings ([1139095](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uwp-legacy-store-icons-arent-removed-from-player-settings))
    
*   Version Control: Assets menu Version Control submenu got moved near top of the menu, into the same place where Collaborate menu is.
    
*   Version Control: Paths outside of the unity project are considered to never be part of version control, e.g. AssetDatabase.IsOpenForEdit will return true for them
    
*   Video: Legacy MovieTexture (Theora-based video playback system) has been removed. Use VideoPlayer instead.
    
*   Windows: Command line arguments '-gpu' and '-adapter' replaced with '-force-device-index' and '-monitor' respectively to be consistent with MacOS and Linux.
    
*   XR: Remove Vuforia built-in functionality from the Editor. Moved to package.

*   Graphics: SetPixelData API was added to Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, Cubemap and CubemapArray classes to allow setting raw texture data directly. This works in a similar way to Texture2D. LoadRawTextureData, but instead of having to precalculate data offset and size, the data can be copied directly to a particular miplevel/array element/cubemap face. ([1162624](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/its-not-possible-to-create-texture2darray-with-compression-because-it-doesnt-have-setrawtexturedata-slash-getrawtexturedata))

*   Android: com.unity.mobile.android-logcat v1.0.0 is now a verified package.
    
*   Android: Unity as a Library enables you to integrate Unity with other native Android applications.

*   Editor: A new column in the Hierarchy window allows users to enable/disable Object picking in the Scene View. An Object that is "Not Pickable" is still be visible in the scene, but is ignored by click or drag-select interactions. Icons in the Object picking column indicate whether or not an Object is pickable. Toggling between Pickable/Not Pickable does not mark the scene as dirty, or affect game data.
    
*   Editor: Users can now disable domain reload and Scene reload when entering Play mode. This can speed up iteration in the editor.
    
*   Editor: Users can now set custom UI scaling on windows across the Editor.

*   Graphics: Ability to specify Mesh submesh information directly, and set index buffer data from NativeArrays. See SubMeshDescriptor, Mesh.SetIndexBufferParams, Mesh.SetIndexBufferData.
    
*   Graphics: Added an experimental Ray Tracing API. The experimental API is currently implemented on top of DirectX Raytracing API (part of DirectX 12 Graphics API) and requires at least Windows 10 October 2018 version (1809) and a DXR-enabled GPU. New objects exposed in C# UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering namespace: RayTracingShader and RayTracingAccelerationStructure. Use SystemInfo.supportsRayTracing for checking if a system supports the Ray Tracing API.
    
*   Graphics: Added Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedProcedural, which is similar to DraMewshInstancedIndirect, but doesn't require compute support (useful for Procedural Instancing)
    
*   Graphics: Added Skinned Mesh rendering support in the SRP Batcher.

*   Particles: Bring managed job support for Particle Systems out of experimental status, and improve the API to support job dependencies, and Burst.
    
    *   Note that this release removes the ParticleSystem.SetJob and ParticleSystem.ClearJob API, and replaces them with MonoBehaviour.OnParticleUpdateJobScheduled, which is the new place to schedule managed Particle System jobs.
*   Physics: PhysX 4.1 upgrade. This brings us lots of accuracy improvements, some better performance in a variety of cases.
    
    Additionally, we expose a few of the new features:
    
    *   a new, faster, midphase that doesn't need R-Trees to be built (see MeshCookingOptions.UseFastMidphase, available on Desktop targets)
    *   a new broadphase algorithm that's faster than sweep-and-prune in most cases (see Automatic Box Pruning in the physics settings)
    *   a new solver that's good for reducing joints issues (see Temporal Gauss-Siedel solver type in the physics settings)
    *   a new Physics.BakeMesh() function to pre-cook meshes for MeshCollider (including off the main thread)
