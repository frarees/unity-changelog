#### Features

*   2D: Following 2D Packages are now verified package com.unity.2d.spriteshape": "3.0.2", "com.unity.2d.animation": "3.0.3", "com.unity.2d.psdimporter": "2.0.3", "com.unity.2d.pixel-perfect": "2.0.2", "com.unity.2d.path":"2.0.1", "com.unity.2d.common":"2.0.1"
    
*   Android: com.unity.mobile.android-logcat v1.0.0 is now a verified package.
    
*   Android: Unity as a Library enables to integrate unity in other native Android applications
    
*   Asset Import: Added New Material Import Mode to the model importer allowing user customization of material generation when importing models.
    
*   DX12: DirectX 12 GPU Shader validation can be enabled on the editor or player using the command line argument "force-d3d12-debug-gbv"
    
*   Editor: A new column in the Hierarchy window allows users to enable/disable Object picking in the Scene View. An Object that is "Not Pickable" is still be visible in the scene, but is ignored by click or drag-select interactions. Icons in the Object picking column indicate whether or not an Object is pickable. Toggling between Pickable/Not Pickable does not mark the scene as dirty, or affect game data.
    
*   Editor: Users can now disable domain reload and Scene reload when entering Play mode. This can speed up iteration in the editor.
    
*   Editor: Users can now set custom UI scaling on windows across the Editor.
    
*   GI: Added Experimental API for modular lighting bake.
    
*   GI: Added support for baking box and pyramid shapes for HDRP spotlights.

*   Graphics: Ability to specify custom Mesh vertex data formats, and set vertex buffer data from NativeArrays. See VertexAttributeFormat, VertexAttributeDescriptor, Mesh.SetVertexBufferParams, Mesh.SetVertexBufferData.
    
*   Graphics: Ability to specify Mesh submesh information directly, and set index buffer data from NativeArrays. See SubMeshDescriptor, Mesh.SetIndexBufferParams, Mesh.SetIndexBufferData.
    
*   Graphics: Added an experimental Ray Tracing API. The experimental API is currently implemented on top of DirectX Raytracing API (part of DirectX 12 Graphics API) and requires at least Windows 10 October 2018 version (1809) and a DXR-enabled GPU. New objects exposed in C# UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering namespace: RayTracingShader and RayTracingAccelerationStructure. Use SystemInfo.supportsRayTracing for checking if a system supports the Ray Tracing API.
    
*   Graphics: Added Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedProcedural, which is similar to DraMewshInstancedIndirect, but doesn't require compute support (useful for Procedural Instancing)
    
*   Graphics: Added RayTracingAccelerationStructure class with NativeTests
    
*   Graphics: Added RayTracingRootSignature class- currently unconnected
    
*   Graphics: On Demand Rendering. Ability to set the rendering speed independently from other engine updates.

    *   a new solver that's good for reducing joints issues (see Temporal Gauss-Siedel solver type in the physics settings)
    *   a new Physics.BakeMesh() function to pre-cook meshes for MeshCollider (including off the main thread)
*   Profiler: Added Deep Profiler support to Mono and IL2CPP players.
    
*   Profiler: Added Deep Profiling support build option to players. When you build a Player with Deep Profiling, C# code instrumentation can be dynamically enabled and disabled.

Every matching Preset will be applied in order to the newly default Object (whether it is created using ObjectFactory API or an importer created for a new file added to the project).
    
*   Graphics: Adding explicit depth resolve to RenderPass Metal
    
*   Graphics: Graphics Jobs is now enabled by default in the 3D Template

*   Timeline: Scrolling horizontally with either the mouse wheel or track pad now pans horizontally in Timeline's clips area.
    
*   Timeline: Scrolling with either the mouse wheel or track pad is now context-sensitive in Timeline. It zooms if the pointer is above the clips area, it pans everywhere else.
    
*   UI Elements: Extended the `Image` class and the `background-image` property to support SVG image assets.
    
*   UI Elements: ListView is now bindable via C# and UXML.

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK
    

##### For running Unity games

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
    
*   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities
    
*   Exported Android Gradle projects require Android Studio 3.4 and later to build
