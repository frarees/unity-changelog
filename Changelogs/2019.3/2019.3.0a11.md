### New 2019.3.0a11 Entries since 2019.3.0a10

#### Features

*   Graphics: Added an experimental Ray Tracing API. The experimental API is currently implemented on top of DirectX Raytracing API (part of DirectX 12 Graphics API) and requires at least Windows 10 October 2018 version (1809) and a DXR-enabled GPU. New objects exposed in C# UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering namespace: RayTracingShader and RayTracingAccelerationStructure. Use SystemInfo.supportsRayTracing for checking if a system supports the Ray Tracing API.

#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   Android: LZ4 compression will be preselected for newly created projects. The set of available compression options is the same.  
    _This is a new issue, not seen in any released version._
    
*   Graphics: Graphics: Added MeshUpdateFlags to Mesh.SetVertexBufferData, SetIndexBufferData, SetSubMesh. Added Mesh.MarkModified. Added Mesh.GetVertexAttribute and Mesh.vertexAttributeCount.  
    _This is a new issue, not seen in any released version._
    

#### Improvements

*   Audio: Better error reporting when audio clips fail to play ([1118840](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-audio-mainthread-check-internal-crashes-when-trying-to-load-corrupted-audioclips))
    
*   Graphics: SetPixelData API was added to Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, Cubemap and CubemapArray classes to allow setting raw texture data directly. This works in a similar way to Texture2D. LoadRawTextureData, but instead of having to precalculate data offset and size, the data can be copied directly to a particular miplevel/array element/cubemap face. ([1162624](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/its-not-possible-to-create-texture2darray-with-compression-because-it-doesnt-have-setrawtexturedata-slash-getrawtexturedata))
    
*   Package Manager: Show Package Manager window instead of the Asset store window in Unity when the user is on a product in the Asset Store on the browser and clicks on `Open in Unity` The Package manager window will automatically select the right product  
    _This is a new issue, not seen in any released version._
    
*   Terrain: Terrain height painting/setting now is operating always in world space coordinates. ([1118605](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/height-of-the-terrain-is-calculated-without-using-y-position-of-the-gameobject-when-setting-height-in-terrain-component))
    

#### API Changes

*   Asset Pipeline: Added experimental API AssetDatabaseExperimental.GetAvailableImporterTypes for listing the importer types which can handle an Asset type.
    
*   Editor: Added EditorUtility.DisplayDialog overload that takes a DialogOptOutDecissionType and an identifying string. Using this overload give users the the ability to opt-out of seeing those modal system dialogs again.
    

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed issue where reimporting Sprite from TextureImporter might check out meta file ([1092018](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/perforce-version-control-automatically-checkouts-reimported-sprites), 1104502)

    _This is a new issue, not seen in any released version._
    
*   Editor: Added Edit/Rename for scene hierarchy

### Preview of Final 2019.3.0a11 Release Notes

#### System Requirements Changes

##### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

#### Features

*   Android: Unity as a Library enables to integrate unity in other native Android applications
    
*   Editor: Domain reload and / or scene reload could be disabled when entering play mode to allow faster iteration times in the editor.
    
*   Editor: Scene Picking - Following the Scene Visibility tools that arrived in 2019.1, a second column has been added for enabling/disabling Picking of objects in the Scene View. An object that is "Not Pickable" will still be visible in the scene, but clicking or drag-selecting in the scene will ignore it. Like Scene Visibility, a status icon is displayed in the Heirarchy column, and customizable shortcuts are provided. Also the same, toggling Pickable/Not Pickable will not mark the scene as dirty, or affect the game data in any way.
    
*   Editor: Users can set custom ui scaling across the editor on windows
    
*   GI: Added Experimental API for modular lighting bake.
    
*   GI: Added support for baking box and pyramid shapes for HDRP spotlights.
