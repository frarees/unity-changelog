Every matching Preset is applied, in order, to the new default Object, regardless of whether it was created using the ObjectFactory API or an importer.
    
*   GI: Deprecated Enlighten, and hid it from new Projects in Scriptable Render Pipelnes. Upgraded Projects will still show it.

*   Version Control: Assets menu Version Control submenu got moved near top of the menu, into the same place where Collaborate menu is.
    
*   Video: Legacy MovieTexture (Theora-based video playback system) has been removed. Use VideoPlayer instead.

*   Graphics: Added Profile Marker "Gfx.WaitForRenderThread"
    
*   Graphics: Version 4.0.3 of the 3D Extra template.
    
*   Graphics: Version 4.0.4 of the 3D Extra template.
