Consider using `Unity.Profiling.Memory.MemoryProfiler.TakeCapture()` which takes a callback as a parameter instead of using an event. It also allows for more specific capture options and if you pass a path to a ".snap"-file, you can use that API to capture memory snapshots from code to later inspect them in the Memory Profiler Package.

    *   If an assembly reload occurs with pending changes on an asset, the changes are applied and the asset re-imported.  
        
    *   Switching between importer override while an asset has pending changes doesn't ask for Apply/Revert/Cancel.  
        
    *   Undo/Redo with modified and re-imported assets will ask for Apply/Revert/Cancel if an undo/redo would have to re-import the affected asset.
