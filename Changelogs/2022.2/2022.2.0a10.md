*   Package Manager: Added the `deprecated` property to the `UnityEditor.PackageManager.VersionsInfo` class (usually accessed through the `versions` property of a `UnityEditor.PackageManager.PackageInfo` instance), which lists all versions of that package that are labelled as deprecated on the registry.
    
*   Package Manager: Added the `isDeprecated` and `deprecationMessage` properties to the `UnityEditor.PackageManager.PackageInfo` class, which are set when a given package version is labelled as deprecated on the registry by its author.
