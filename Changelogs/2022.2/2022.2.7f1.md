### 2022.2.7f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Editor: Added option to Scene View preferences to only refresh the Scene view when the Editor is in focus.

- Package Manager: Added Web3 as a Filter Category in My Assets.



#### Improvements

- Core: Boot config option `no-main-thread-job-stealing=true` can be used to prevent the main thread from ever stealing job work. This option should only be used under special circumstances where very long running jobs cannot be broken down, and the main thread has a high likelihood of running long running work inadvertently.

- IL2CPP: Improved error message when the GenericSharingVisitor encounters an opcode that it cannot handle.

- Shadergraph: The asset postprocessor for shader graph now only performs the majority of its work when a shader-related asset has been changed.

- UI Toolkit: Improved performance of tree expansion of UI Toolkit TreeViews.



#### Changes

- Graphics: Combined unity_ProbesOcclusion into SHCoefficients for BatchRendererGroup.
    (UUM-24996)
