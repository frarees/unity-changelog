### 2022.2.2f1 Release Notes

#### Features

-   Universal RP: Added Temporal Anti-aliasing support. Available from Camera Anti-aliasing settings. Known limitations: Incompatible with MSAA, Dynamic Resolution or Camera stacking. Supports fixed resolution only, no temporal upsampling supported.

#### Improvements

-   Build Pipeline: Improved error handling for builds to show less redundant error messages.

-   Editor: Improved performance of Handles.DrawAAPolyLine.

-   Editor: Improved performance of rendering the Project Settings. It would previously repeatedly query all objects loaded into the editor, which meant that operations that load assets into memory (entering playmode) would make the Project Settings unusable slow.

-   Graphics: Registration of the Shader.globalRenderpipeline is done internaly and using the renderPipelineShaderTag from the RenderPipelineAsset that is currently in use.

-   Physics: Increased the Articulation Body tree limit from 64 to 256 bodies.

-   Profiler: Reduced the performance cost of drawing charts in the profiler.

-   VFX Graph: Fixed lightmap range limitations.(UUM-19058)

#### API Changes

-   Build Pipeline: Obsoleted: Application.SetBuildTags and Application.GetBuildTags are now obsolete.

-   Graphics: Added: Overridable property renderPipelineShaderTag on the RenderPipelineAsset.

#### Changes

-   Universal RP: Shader parameters used by additional lights are now removed when additional lights are disabled in URP Assets.

#### Fixes

-   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where the standalone profiler could crash or emit errors when the script domain reloads in the editor.([UUM-19179](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/edit-mode-recording-standalone-profiler-crashes-on-stopassetimportingv2internal-when-reloading-the-domain))

-   Build Pipeline: Doing a clean build will remember state about built files, so that files no longer in a build can be deleted in subsequent builds.

-   Build Pipeline: Fixed a bug where building a development player, and then a non-development player with no other changes could show the \"Development Player\" watermark.

-   Build Pipeline: Fixed a potential bug where building players could in rare circumstances fail with a sharing violation on a file called buildreport.json_2.traceevents.

-   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where build GUIDs would sometimes not change between subsequent builds.

-   Build Pipeline: Make postprocess callbacks correctly report player path for \"install in builds folder\".(UUM-4118)

-   Core: Fixed ShaderGraph code generation to properly enable GPU instanced properties.([UUM-20505](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-shader-instance-property-gets-added-to-cbuffer-which-causes-gpu-instancing-with-instanced-properties-to-not-work))

-   Editor: Added EditorSceneManager event for RestoreSceneManagerSetup so systems can get notified about it.(UUM-19655)

-   Editor: Camera relative culling options have been added to the Graphics section in Project Settings. This will potentially alleviate light popping issues due to lack of precision when the objects or lights are far from the origin. Enabling the camera relative culling setting for lights will potentially introduces issues for objects or lights that are far from the camera origin.([UUM-7551](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/spot-light-flickers-when-when-its-far-from-the-origin-point))

-   Editor: Converting the root in a Prefab Asset to a Prefab instance to create a variant is now disallowed, similarly as Replace Prefab instance. This guard is added to prevent loosing default overrides and references for all instances of the Prefab.\'.([UUM-20181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2022-dot-2-feature-reconnect-to-prefab-in-prefab-mode-can-break-references))

-   Editor: Fixed a bug when zooming in using the orthographic camera, the terrain texture was previously rendered incorrectly. Now when zooming in, the texture on the terrain should be rendered correctly.([UUM-1809](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/patches-of-terrain-lose-detail-when-zoomed-in-with-orthographic-camera))

-   Editor: Fixed a bug which caused**auto**with**Generate Lighting**to not work as expected in connection with DOTS. Auto mode will now be ignored in the backend when the core Entities package is used.\<br\>**Note:**An inspector window and the lighting settings window will show the value of \'Auto Generate\' which has been set in the lighting settings asset. The lighting window will show a warning if**Auto Generate**is ticked but it will not prevent the user from doing so.\<br\>Note that the following lighting window UI changes have been included in the fix:\<br\>**Auto Generate**is not disabled when the Entities package is used. The checkbox will represent the actual value in the lighting settings asset.\<br\>The warning is only shown if**Auto Generate**is ticked and the text is updated to say**Auto Generate mode is ignored \[\...\]**.(UUM-18955)

-   Editor: Fixed a crash when a window is closed during EditorWindow.OnLostFocus.([UUM-12434](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/error-slash-crash-when-editorwindow-dot-close-is-called-in-editorwindow-dot-onlostfocus))
