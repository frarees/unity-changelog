### 2022.2.13f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Graphics: Added BatchCullingContext.cullingFlags to specify whether lightmapped shadow casters should be culled for this view.



#### Improvements

- Apple TV: TvOS now uses launch screen storyboard.

- iOS: IOS/tvOS launch screen now is shown only by OS, and is not shown again by Unity itself.

- Player: Added -native-leak-detection command line argument to Unity Editor and standalone players. can be Disabled, Enabled, or EnabledWithStackTrace. Stack Traces are only available in the Unity Editor and development builds.



#### API Changes

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` returns the maximum number of job workers that can work on a job at the same time. The job system will create a number of job worker threads that will be no greater than the number of logical CPU cores for the platform. However, since arbitrary threads can execute jobs via work stealing we allocate extra workers which act as temporary job worker threads. `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` reflects the maximum number of job worker threads<br>
    plus temporary workers the job system will ever use. As such, this value is useful for allocating buffers which should be subdivided evenly between job workers since `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` and `NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute` will never return a value greater than `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`.
    (UUM-29945)

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` returns the index for the current thread when executing a job, otherwise 0. When multiple threads are working on a parallel job at once, no two threads will have the same index. The range is \[0, `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`\). The value returned when called from within a job is the same as the one stored in a job member decorated with `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute`, otherwise 0.
    (UUM-29945)

- Editor: Added: GetSampleMetadataAsSpan to RawFrameDataView.



#### Changes

- Kernel: Made NativeArray.Dispose consistent when disposing uninitialized container.

- Version Control: Updated branding from "Plastic SCM" to "Unity Version Control"<br>
    Improved offline experience by disabling the plugin when there is no internet connection.
