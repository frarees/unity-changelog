- VFX Graph: Replaced default mesh output shader to be SRP compatible.
    (UUM-4363)

- Virtual Texturing: Virtual texturing has a severe issue: the mip chain is not available on the first frame, causing unpredictable garbage texles to be displayed on the screen. This fix helps with poping by adding a new setting to the HDRP asset. This setting lets us allocate virtual texturing mips prefetching. This setting also had to be implemented inside the VT system.<br>
    A debug panel also has live reporting of the current prefetched mips in the markers debug screen. We also add a checkbox to debug disable streaming, which helps content creators see which textures are on and off.
    (UUM-29814)

- Windows: Fixed sizeof type error in StackWalker library.
