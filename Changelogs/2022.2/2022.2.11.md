### 2022.2.11f1 Release Notes

#### Features

-   SpeedTree: HDRP/Nature/SpeedTree8.shadergraph now uses its Subsurface Map for the Transmission Mask node to remove the unintended light transmission from tree barks and twigs. This also fixes the overly bright billboard lighting which didn\'t quite match the 3D geometry\'s lighting.

-   Package Manager: Extended support for specifying optional path and revision to Git URLs in SCP format.

#### Fixes

-   2D: Fixed the Tile Palette repainting a position when doing a mouse drag at the same position.(UUM-27588)
