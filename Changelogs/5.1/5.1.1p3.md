### Improvements

*   Animation: Group material color channel curves. Removing one curve will automatically remove other channel curves of the same color property.
*   Editor: Informative message will be shown in the material inspector when the material property block values are used.

### Changes

*   Xbox One: Unity now builds with the June 2015 XDK. You must have the June XDK installed on your PC and use the matching or later recovery on your console.
