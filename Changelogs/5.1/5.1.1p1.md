### Known Issues

*   VR: When upgrading an Oculus / GearVR project from the legacy Oculus Unity Integration Plugin to 5.1 Unity VR, be sure to remove any Oculus plugins from your project to avoid deploy / runtime errors.
*   GearVR: Unity Personal Edition with 5.1 Unity VR support results in a crash. Please use the Oculus Unity Integration Plugin until this issue is resolved in a future patch.
