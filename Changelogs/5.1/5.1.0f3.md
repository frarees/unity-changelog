### Features

*   New multiplayer networking feature introduced, see the manual and UnityEngine.Networking namespace in the script reference for details. This includes low level API (transport layer) and a higher level API with many features to help implement multiplayer functionality in games. Cloud based relay service can be used to get past NAT restrictions, and a simple matchmaking service can be used for game/host discovery. To configure the services go to [https://multiplayer.unity3d.com](https://multiplayer.unity3d.com). The current RakNet based multiplayer system will be deprecated but still functional in this release.
*   New network components and NetworkBehaviour base class for network aware scripts:

*   Added integrated support for Oculus Rift in Editor and Standalone Players, see the Manual and UnityEngine.VR namespace script reference for details Once Virtual Reality is enabled in Player Settings, pressing play in the editor will show your game view on the Rift. It is recommended to "Maximize on Play" the game view and run the Oculus Rift in Extended mode in order to achieve the smoothest rendering. Be sure to remove any previous Oculus plugins and assets from your project, or update to the latest version that supports 5.1.
    *   VR optimization: Render shadows only once and share between eyes.
    *   VR optimization: Cull once for both eyes.
    *   Support for Oculus 0.6.0-beta runtime

*   New HDR Color Picker
    *   Improves the Standard shader workflow for changing the emission color property.
    *   The emission color can now be animated from the animation window.
    *   Using scripting API to change emission will now be reflected in the shader gui.
    *   Color Presets now also support HDR colors. Saving a HDR color will overlay a lowercase 'h' on the preset swatch.
    *   Color property fields can now be customized with the ColorUsageAttribute (show/hide alpha value, is HDR)
    *   Added Hex color field

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image10.png?itok=K315nLUv)

*   Graphics: Crunch texture compression format on platforms which support DXT. This is a lossy compression that is both small on disk/download and compressed (DXT1/DXT5) for the GPU.

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image06.png?itok=jJZ-r5Mq)

*   Graphics: Experimental support for OpenGL 4.5 and ES 3.1 on Windows. Use -force-glcore, -force-gles(20|30|31|31aep) arguments to enable. This enables testing OpenGL ES 3.1 features on desktop. Note: no GL4 support on Mac or Linux yet.
    *   Graphics: OpenGL ES 3.1 support on Android
    *   New graphics levels (OpenGL ES 3.1, OpenGL ES 3.1 + AEP)
    *   Compute shaders
    *   Geometry shaders
    *   Tessellation shaders
    *   Advanced blend modes
    *   Note: OpenGL ES 3.0/3.1 uses a new shader compiler backend; see Changes below.
*   New runtime assertion library under UnityEngine.Assertions namespace. The library provides a set of methods for setting assertions in your code.
    *   The method calls will be conditionally compiled out from non-developer’s builds.
    *   The conditional compilation is controlled by UNITY\_ASSERTION define.
    *   Defines DEBUG and TRACE are now also defined for non-developer’s builds.
    *   A wrapping library providing extension methods is also available under UnityEngine.Assertions.Must namespace.
*   Unity Analytics: new, built-in Analytics functionality introduced (currently in “Preview”), under the UnityEngine.Analytics namespace.
    *   Basic Integration can be completed by inserting a unique ProjectId into “Cloud Project Id” in PlayerSettings.

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image04.png?itok=ut4sD0Hc)

*   The ProjectId is a unique identifier that links your Editor project with the data on your Analytics dashboard, and is generated during the Basic Integration process.
    *   Go to http://analytics.unity3d.com to get started with Basic Integration, as well as access the relevant documentation and integration instructions.
    *   Additionally, the library provides methods to track Monetization, Custom Events, and User Attributes (otherwise known as Advanced Integration options).

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image07.png?itok=u9YVpVUZ)

*   Note: 4.x and 5.0 Editor users can still use Analytics by integrating the downloadable SDK package. For 5.1 users, adding the plug-in should not result in errors, nor will it result in duplicate data, but we still advise that you remove the old plug-in assets.
*   Home Window Login integration. You can now login or work offline using the home window or command-line arguments.

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image03.png?itok=BiAi-DMC)

*   Home Window License integration. You can now validate your serial and activate your copy of Unity using the new 5.1 json licensing API through the home window.

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   Animation: Change the behaviour for humanoid controller with generic clip animating a human transform. Before the generic animation for the Human transform had a higher priority than the human animation. Now the Human animation always have the highest priority for humanoid rig overriding any generic animation for this transform, you should see a warning in the inspector if such case is detected with the name of the faulty animation clip and which transform is affected.
*   Physics: Modifying the HingeJoint Limit, Motor, Spring properties will no longer automatically enable the them. You now need to explicitly set HingeJoint.useLimit, useMotor, useSpring.
*   XboxOne: Unity is now built with the April 2015 XDK. You will need to install the April 2015 XDK on your PC and use the same or later recovery on your console.

### Changes

*   Animation: Added warning message for transitions without any condition. Those transitions are ignored.
*   Animation: Animator.speed can only be negative when the recorder is enabled. Now when the recorder is offline we do clamp the speed to 0 to avoid negative speed.
*   Animation: Transitions now have a fixed duration by default. Before Transition duration was in normalized time.
*   Animation Window: Dope sheet editor uses Command instead of Control for toggle-selecting on Mac OS
*   Animation Window: Double-clicking a key in the curve editor now selects the whole curve. Double-clicking part of the curve still creates a new key at this position
*   Editor: Incremental naming of instantiated GameObjects to use format: MyName, MyName (1), MyName (2)

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image02.png?itok=0eL3H7Dq)

*   Editor: Renamed and added new GizmoType enum values to be more explicit about how they work with selection hierarchy. See the docs.
*   Editor: Ensure GameView is un-maximized on Editor start up.
*   GI: Auto baking is now disabled by default in 2D projects.
*   GI: Change the "continuous baking" label to something shorter and better. Is now "Auto" with a tooltip added.
*   GI: When hard shadows are selected baking will use a directional spread of 0 and a point radius of 0. Also, the UI for spread/point are disabled when shadows are not set to soft.
*   Graphics: Deprecated player settings useDirect3D11, targetGlesGraphics, targetIOSGraphics properties. Use SetGraphicsAPIs and friends.
*   Graphics: LOD fade mode is now assigned to the whole LODGroup as None, Cross-fade or SpeedTree.
*   Graphics: Make Material(string) constructor script API obsolete with a warning. Support for creating fixed function shaders at runtime will be removed in the future.
*   Input: Default binding for 'Fire3' in new projects changed from Left Cmd to Left Shift, for benefit of Windows user experience.
*   iOS: By default iOS builds now only support Metal & OpenGL ES 2.0. If you need OpenGL ES 3.0, you can specify that under player settings.
*   Networking: The NetworkView component from the old network system was marked as deprecated.
*   Physics: Enabling the HingeJoint Motor overrides the spring, if the spring was enabled. If the motor is again disabled the spring will be restored. This restores Unity4 functionality.
*   Physics: HingeJoint MinBounce and MaxBounce are replaced by a single 'bounciness' for both limit ends. The new bounciness will be set to the largest of the old MinBounce and MaxBounce.
*   Physics: New HingeJoint initialization fixes target angle being measured incorrectly.
*   Shaders: OpenGL ES 3.0+ will use a new shader compiler backend. Based on HLSL + HLSLCrossCompiler + glsl-optimizer. This enables compute shaders on ES3.1 and other modern features. Existing Cg/HLSL compute, geometry and tessellation shaders can be used via automatic translation as well as with direct GLSL snippets. Note: Memory layout rule differences between DX and GL must be taken into account on the buffer data uploads.
*   Substance: Substances are now supported in both 32b and 64b iOS simulator builds.
*   Terrain: TerrainData.alphamapTextures is now exposed to script.
*   Version Control: Allow edit of imported/native asset with respect to meta/asset file being checked out
*   WebGL: Memory size is now written to the generated HTML to make it easier to change it without rebuilding the player.
*   WebGL: Player Settings UI is now consistent with other platforms.
*   WebGL: Static batching is now disabled by default to improve build sizes.
*   WebGL: Switch audio format used to AAC.

### Improvements

*   Android: Apply DeviceDefault theme if available, respect user's theme
*   Android: Improved soft input dialog
*   Android: New Sensor/rotation code that tries to figure out 'reversed rotation devices'
*   Animation: Added Animator.CrossFadeInFixedTime and Animator.PlayInFixedTime to support fixed time manual transitions.
*   Animation: Added AnimatorController.GetBehaviours() API function to simplify how user can query their behaviour on the asset
*   Animation: Added dragging controls on the time bar and on the background of the blending in the transition inspector
*   Animation: Added options "Add Motion", "Add Blend Tree" and "Delete" to contextual menu for blend tree
*   Animation: Allow animator window to be locked
*   Animation: Deleting a layer that has other layers synchronized on itself will also delete all the dependent layers (with a prompt)
*   Animation: Do not allow scene objects in AnimatorController's Motion ObjectField
*   Animation: Exposed ApplyBuiltinRootMotion to script
*   Animation: Retargeting import warnings are removed from the console and are now available in the model importer warning foldout. This will simplify the submission process for Animation Clip to the asset store.

*   Animation Window: Curve editor supports range selection with shift-click
*   Animation Window: Curve editor supports toggle selection with command-click (control-click on Windows)
*   Animation Window: Direct editing of key values in curve editors. Use Enter/Return or context menu to start editing selected keys, Tab to switch between fields, Enter/Return to commit, and Escape to cancel editing
*   Animation Window: Dope sheet editor supports Control-click as well as right-click on Mac OS
*   Animation Window: Dragging a curve no longer loses the current selection
*   Animation Window: Keyframe selection is synced between dopesheet and curve view.
*   Animation Window: Lock button that locks the selection to currently selected clip and Animator.
*   Animation Window: Slightly increased the clickable radius for keyframes in the curve editor
*   Animation Window: When creating new clip from animation window, default to previously used path
*   BuildPipeline: There will be fewer differences between the exported data files from subsequent builds of your project when using the same version of Unity. For best results, close Unity and delete your project's Library folder before making an important build.
*   Curve Editor: Wrap mode enum popup modified to appear as a little gear, which fits nicely in the margin without being cropped.
*   Documentation: Show "construct type" for class/struct/interface
*   Editor: Added extensive support for copy/pasting colors: Copy/paste from focused color field, from context menu for color field, from color picker (with no text selected) and from hex field.
*   Editor: Adding an icon to an EditorWindow title is now exposed by using the GUIContent 'titleContent' property (the old string 'title' is now obsolete)
*   Editor: Create sprite animation clip from project window context menu.
*   Editor: Improved grid in Scene View. Eliminates the popping and inconsistent draw distance of the old grid, and also draws grid lines smaller than one unit (10th of a unit, 100th of a unit and so on) when sufficiently zoomed in. New grid shading makes it possible to have grid lines more dense in close parts of the grid without the parts further away being too dense.
*   Editor: Introduced CreateAssetMenu attribute. Apply it to ScriptableObject-derived types to cause them to show up automatically in the Assets/Create menu.
*   Editor: Introduced HelpURL attribute, for setting custom documentation URL for user-authored classes.
*   Editor: Simple expression evaluator for all number fields. Supports + - / \* % ( ) operators. This means that all number fields can be used as a calculator.
*   FrameDebugger: Shader blend, depth and raster states will be shown for draw calls.
*   GI: Final gather was moved into a separate stage. This allows the indirect baking stage to apply visibility aware upsampling to the indirect lightmap before final gather is applied for better quality.
*   GI: Reduce the amount of GI related information that is written to the log file
*   Graphics: Add CommandBuffer.DrawProcedural and DrawProceduralIndirect.
*   Graphics: Added a way to specify graphics APIs explicitly in player settings (defaults to "automatic" for each platform). For example, you could specify you only want to support Metal+ES2 in iOS builds, or only DX11 (without DX9 fallback) on Windows builds etc. This replaces the "Use DX11" and "Target iOS/GLES Graphics" settings.
*   Graphics: Added SetPixels32/GetPixels32 to Texture3D.
*   Graphics: Command Buffers can be set on Lights, see LightEvent enum and Light.AddCommandBuffer.
*   Graphics: Performance improvements on DX11 when many non-batchable objects are in view.
*   Importer: Added warning foldout to keep trace of all import warning in the ModelImporter animation tab.

*   Physics: Add motion constraints to Rigidbody2D

![description](/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image05.png?itok=powWquhm)

*   Physics: Added HingeJoint BounceMinVelocity. When bounciness is enabled this is the minimum impact velocity which will cause the joint to bounce. Setting this very low, like zero, will cause the joint to never stop bouncing. This can lead to jittering and performance problems. Setting this very high will cause joint to never bounce.
*   Physics: Optimized performance of ‘OnTriggerStay’ messaging.
*   Physics: Rigidbodies connected to a HingeJoint will now automatically be woken up when the joint is updated.
*   Plugin Inspector: You can now select multiple plugins and change compatible platforms. Note - you cannot yet change per platform settings if multiple plugins are selected.
*   Profiler: Change ms markers in timeline view to use same label style which makes it also properly visible in both skins.
*   Profiler: Don't show FPS for every ms marker along the x axis in the timeline view - only for the last one.
*   Profiler: Fix unaligned labels for ms counts in current frame.
*   Scripting: Added Vector2.Reflect function.
*   Serialization: Extended SerializedFile size limit to 4GB
*   Shaders: Support VFACE in surface shader inputs; just use a float variable with VFACE semantic.
*   SpeedTree: A new importer setting "Animate Cross-fading" is added to SpeedTree assets. With this option on (by default), the dithering LOD transition between mesh/billboard and billboard/culled will be animated by time. This should make the trees look better in most of the scenarios.
*   SpeedTree: Now wind animation will not be interrupted if the tree gets out side of the view.
*   SpeedTree: Tree casts shadow when in cross-fading to billboard
*   Texture2D: Add Texture2D.GetRawTextureData() API
*   UI: Allow dragging anchors outside of bounds of parent when holding down Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) - the same key that disables snapping. This makes it easier to author screen transitions that support multiple resolutions, since content can be animated to move a distance that's a percentage of the screen width or height.
*   UI: Changed default blink rate and widget range of InputField caret to match the new frequency behavior.
*   Version Control: CheckoutIsValid now accept a CheckoutMode
*   Version Control: Collapse assets and their .meta files in versioning window when they have the same state
*   WebGL: Made "Explicitly Thrown Exceptions Only" mode much faster and be the default setting
*   WebGL: Support Input.touches and Input.acceleration
*   Windows Store Apps: Copy pasting will also work outside the application.
*   Windows Store Apps: Exposed Rendering path in Player Settings
*   Windows Store Apps: Refactored App.xaml.cs and MainPage.xaml.cs, it's easier now to add additional XAML pages to the project
*   XboxOne: Added functions to XboxOnePLM (GetActivationUri, GetActivationTileId, GetActivationArguments) to retrieve cached values. We still recommend listening to OnActivationEvent in your Start() frame, and processing them that way, but this provides an alternative for last-provided values.
*   XboxOne: Added support for XMA audio format
*   XboxOne: IPv6 lookup and DNS support added for C# code.
*   XboxOne: Lightmap files are now split up per level and put in separate chunks in the package manifest.
*   XboxOne: More comments have been added to the default package manifest.
*   XboxOne: Worker threads created by Unity's core systems (Physics, AI) will no longer run on cores 0 and 1, which are reserved for the Rendering thread and Unity's main thread respectively. This will be a performance gain in most cases by avoiding thread context switches.
