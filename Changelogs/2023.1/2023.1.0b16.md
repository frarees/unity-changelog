- Build Pipeline: Added: Added new signature for BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.

- Build Pipeline: Added: Made BuildReport.GetLastestReport and BuildReport.SummarizeErrors public and documented.

- Core: Added: Added overload of GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag that takes a List&lt;GameObject&gt; to bypass allocations.

- Core: Added: Added several new batch Transform APIs that can process multiple points or vectors in a single API call rather than having to make repeated calls on each point in turn which drastically improves performance<br>
    Transform.TransformPoints\(\) - batch version of Transform.TransformPoint\(\)<br>
    Transform.TransformDirections\(\) - batch version of Transform.TransformDirection\(\)<br>
    Transform.TransformVectors\(\) - batch version of Transform.TransformVector\(\)<br>
    Transform.InverseTransformPoints\(\) - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformPoint\(\)<br>

- Core: Added: Debug.developerConsoleEnabled toggles the IMGUI-based developer console in development builds.

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` returns the maximum number of job workers that can work on a job at the same time. The job system will create a number of job worker threads that will be no greater than the number of logical CPU cores for the platform. However, since arbitrary threads can execute jobs via work stealing we allocate extra workers which act as temporary job worker threads. `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` reflects the maximum number of job worker threads<br>
    plus temporary workers the job system will ever use. As such, this value is useful for allocating buffers which should be subdivided evenly between job workers since `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` and `NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute` will never return a value greater than `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`.
    (UUM-29945)

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` returns the index for the current thread when executing a job, otherwise 0. When multiple threads are working on a parallel job at once, no two threads will have the same index. The range is \[0, `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`\). The value returned when called from within a job is the same as the one stored in a job member decorated with `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute`, otherwise 0.

    * D3DHDRDisplayBitDepth::D3DHDRDisplayBitDepth16 has been replaced by HDRDisplayBitDepth::BitDepth16<br>
    Calls to the obsolete enums will be automatically updated to the new one. If using enum names as strings, ensure that the new ones get used as it won't be automatically converted to the new ones.

In the latter case the function can be many times faster as no internal sorting is required.  See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.

- Scripting: Added: New Object.FindObjectsByType\(\) function added to replace the now obsoleted Object.FindObjectsOfType\(\).  This new function gives users the choice whether or not to perform the expensive sorting by InstanceID on the returned collection of objects rather than having it always performed wasting time when unnecessary.  See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType\(\) and Object.FindObjectsOfType\(\) for more details.

Use the new Object.FindObjectsByType\(\) function by preference passing either FindObjectsSortMode.InstanceID to maintain sorting by InstanceID or FindObjectsSortMode.None to not sort the results. Not sorting the results is significantly faster but be aware that the order of the returned results will be different and not necessarily consistent between calls.  See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.

- Android: Added support for Android SDK 31 and 33.

- Android: Android SDK must have cmdline-tools component installed now. Unity will ignore tools component.

- Android: Changed the default scripting backend to IL2CPP for new projects. Existing projects will not be impacted.

- Android: Default gradle templates have changed significantly with new Gradle and AGP versions. Gradle templates in existing projects will have to be recreated based on new default templates when upgrading projects created with previous Unity versions.

- Android: Modified FrameLayout so you can call getFrameLayout function on UnityPlayer instance if you need access to frame layout. UnityPlayer/UnityPlayerForActivityOrService no longer derives from FrameLayout.

- Android: Modified the input device listener so it now processes the callback on the UI thread. The callbacks were previously being processed in Unity's main thread but this is incompatible with the GameActivity setup, where Java looper is not present on Unity's main thread.

- Android: Removed a validation error which checks if activities specified in manifest are present as java files. Activities can be implemented in jar files, so Unity is unable to check that.

- Android: Removed editor UI option which allowed to choose between R8 and Proguard tools to minify code. New AGP version doesn't have an option to minify using proguard. Instead R8 is always used.

- Apple TV: Changed the minimum supported OS version to tvOS13.

- Asset Bundles: When the Asset Bundle cache layout was changed in 2017, an automatic migration codepath was added to check for asset bundles in the old cache location and move them into the new cache, so that end users would not need to re-download the bundles just because the cache layout changed. As 5 years have now passed, it is unlikely that this automatic migration still has any value, so the behavior has been removed.

- Burst: Burst now only generates full debug information when "Native Debug Mode Compilation" and script debug information is enabled.

- Burst: Changed Burst Inspector input handling so that arrow-keys can be used to select in search boxes.
