-   Physics 2D: Added a` Rigidbody2D.Slide `method which allows a Rigidbody2D to be moved with a specific velocity over a specific integration time and perform various slide, gravity, slip, direction-change, and surface-anchoring behaviours automatically. This can be used on all body types including Static. This method can simply calculate a new position, change the Rigidbody2D position immediately (supports interpolation), or defer the movement by automatically calling` Rigidbody2D.MovePosition() `. This feature will make Character Controllers easier to create.

-   SRP Core: Added Adaptive Probe volumes (APV) for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

-   SRP Core: Added debug view to visualize probe sampling.

-   URP: Added Blur Quality dropdown for SSAO to select High (Bilateral), Medium (Gaussian), or Low (Single-Pass Kawase).
