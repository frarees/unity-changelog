### 2023.1.1f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Test Framework: Added TestFileReferences.json to be generated on build step of the player, so can be consumed later by Test runners to enrich data for run part.

- Test Framework: By using the editor command line new argument -randomOrderSeed x you can run the tests in a randomized order, where x is an integer different from 0. If a new test is added in the project the random order passing the same seed will be kept, and the new test will be placed in the random list accordigly.

- Test Framework: The UTF version now automatically updates for SRP tests



#### Improvements

- Editor: Fixed an issue where RFloat / RGFloat / RGBAFloat formats were not useable in the Texture Importer Inspector even though they already could be applied through, for example, an AssetPostprocessor.

- Graphics: Graphics.Blit now supports source signed textures \(no remapping if blitting from signed to unsigned\).
    (UUM-6249)

- VFX Graph: Allows texture types to be used in branch operators
    ([UUM-38037](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vfx-graph-branch-node-does-not-accept-texture-input))

- VFX Graph: VFX systems receiving GPU events can now go into sleep state



#### Changes

- Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where the AssetImportManager could crash while registering scripts if a script became unreachable during a domain reload

    ([UUM-35527](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/entities-linux-il2cpp-player-crash-stack-trace-is-displayed-multiple-times-when-the-build-is-run-with-batchmode-nographics-arguments))

    ([UUM-36485](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-particlesystemupdatedata-release-when-opening-or-playing-a-particle-system-prefab))

- Serialization: It is not possible to instantiate abstract class, which is happening in this case. The fix for editor crash is to make sure that the abstract StatusEffect class is not instantiated in SerializedReference fields. You can achieve this by either changing all the occurrences, or add \[MovedFrom\(true, sourceClassName:"StatusEffect"\)\] attribute to StatusEffectComplex class.
    ([UUM-9218](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-with-the-file-memorystream-is-corrupted-when-opening-a-scene))

- Serialization: When serializing empty managed object reference we are not adding the data node in the YAML, which is causing problems after some fields are added to the script and the YAML is being de-serialized. In this case, as there still is not any data node in the YAML, the deserialization process is not instantiating the managed object correctly.
    ([UUM-2258](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/changes-to-an-empty-serializereference-class-causes-data-errorswhen-selecting-a-previously-created-asset))

    ([UUM-37468](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/incompatible-keyword-states-error))

- Shaders: Fixed progress bar sometimes not appearing when "Compile and show code" button is pressed in the shader inspector.
    ([UUM-27865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-compilation-stuck-on-0-slash-6144-variants-ready-when-trying-to-compile-a-shader))

- Test Framework: Fix for WebGL platform target to close the browser tab when the run is completed.

    ([UUM-30367](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-toolkit-spaces-between-letters-are-too-big-when-using-align-equals-justified-tag))

- TextCore: Ensure &lt;voffset&gt; tag affects the preferred height values.

    ([UUM-8181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-select-all-text-when-using-slash-r-escape-character))

- UI Toolkit: Fixed UI Toolkit not rendering in render texture when launched in batch mode.
    ([UUM-26763](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-toolkit-is-not-rendered-when-the-player-is-launched-in-batch-mode))

- URP: Fixed redundant blit is used due to postFX, although it is disabled in rendererData.
    ([UUM-31474](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/quest-urp-enabling-post-processing-on-a-camera-when-its-disabled-on-the-urp-settings-forces-rendering-into-an-intermediate-texture))

- WebGL: - Fixed webCamTexture.DidUpdateThisFrame not getting correctly updated
    ([UUM-29274](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webcamtexture-dot-didupdatethisframe-returns-true-only-for-the-first-frame-when-the-project-is-built-for-webgl))

- Windows: Fixed a bug with multi-channel audio input on Windows. If we tried to capture from a microphone with more than 2 channels, Microphone.Start would fail and an "Unsupported file or audio format" error would appear in the console.
    (UUM-26565)
