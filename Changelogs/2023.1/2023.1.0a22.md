In the latter case the function can be many times faster as no internal sorting is required.  See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.

- Scripting: Added: New Object.FindObjectsByType\(\) function added to replace the now obsoleted Object.FindObjectsOfType\(\).  This new function gives users the choice whether or not to perform the expensive sorting by InstanceID on the returned collection of objects rather than having it always performed wasting time when unnecessary.  See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType\(\) and Object.FindObjectsOfType\(\) for more details.

Use the new Object.FindObjectsByType\(\) function by preference passing either FindObjectsSortMode.InstanceID to maintain sorting by InstanceID or FindObjectsSortMode.None to not sort the results. Not sorting the results is significantly faster but be aware that the order of the returned results will be different and not necessarily consistent between calls.  See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.

- URP: Obsoleted: RenderSingleCamera is now obsolete. Please use RenderPipeline.SubmitRenderRequest with RequestData of the SingleCameraRequest type.<br>
    Graphics: Camera.SubmitRenderRequests is now obsolete. Please use RenderPipeline.SubmitRenderRequest with RequestData of a supported type such as RenderPipeline.StandardRequest.



#### Changes

- 2D: Added support for different sized texture inputs in ImagePacker.

- 2D: Disabled Sprite Library modification in the Component's Inspector and added a button to export changes to an Asset.

- 2D: Expand and frame on bone selection.

- 2D: Fixed pasting unassociated data to Skinning Editor so it no longer throws console errors.

- 2D: Modified PSD Importer so that it no longer depends on 2D Animation.

- 2D: Moved **Pixel Per Unit** and **Worldspace UV** fill settings adjacent to **Stretch UV** to have all fill settings grouped together.

- 2D: Refactored internal triangulation and tessellation APIs.

- 2D: Refactored internal triangulation and tessellation APIs.

- 2D: Simplified the Psd Layer storage. There is now only one storage: Psd Layers.

- 2D: Simplified the Sprite Meta Data storage. There are now 3 storages: Single Sprite, Multiple Sprites, and Mosaiac \(Atlased\) Sprites.

- Android: Added support for Android SDK 31 and 33.

- Android: Android SDK must have cmdline-tools component installed now. Unity will ignore tools component.

- Android: Changed the default scripting backend to IL2CPP for new projects. Existing projects will not be impacted.

- Android: Default gradle templates have changed significantly with new Gradle and AGP versions. Gradle templates in existing projects will have to be recreated based on new default templates when upgrading projects created with previous Unity versions.

- Android: JDK 11 is required now to build Android apps.

- Android: Modified FrameLayout so you can call getFrameLayout function on UnityPlayer instance if you need access to frame layout. UnityPlayer/UnityPlayerForActivityOrService no longer derives from FrameLayout.

- Android: Modified the input device listener so it now processes the callback on the UI thread. The callbacks were previously being processed in Unity's main thread but this is incompatible with the GameActivity setup, where Java looper is not present on Unity's main thread.

- Android: Removed a validation error which checks if activities specified in manifest are present as java files. Activities can be implemented in jar files, so Unity is unable to check that.

- Android: Removed editor UI option which allowed to choose between R8 and Proguard tools to minify code. New AGP version doesn't have an option to minify using proguard. Instead R8 is always used.

- Android: Unity Now uses Android Gradle Plugin 7.1.2 by default.

- Android: Unity Now uses Gradle 7.2 by default.

- Animation: Added support for Physics SimulationMode and Physics2D SimulationMode2D in the Animator and Animation component.

- Apple TV: Changed the minimum supported OS version to tvOS13.

- Asset Bundles: When the Asset Bundle cache layout was changed in 2017, an automatic migration codepath was added to check for asset bundles in the old cache location and move them into the new cache, so that end users would not need to re-download the bundles just because the cache layout changed. As 5 years have now passed, it is unlikely that this automatic migration still has any value, so the behavior has been removed.

- Documentation: Added documentation for public-facing methods EditorUserBuildSettings.SwitchActiveBuildTarget, NamedBuildTarget.FromBuildTargetGroup, and NamedBuildTarget.ToBuildTargetGroup.

- Documentation: Added more details to documentation for material and texture export.

- Documentation: Added troubleshooting documentation for exporting camera animation only from Maya plugin.

- UI Toolkit: ColorField is now UI Toolkit based and does not rely on an IMGUIContainer.

- UI Toolkit: Escape sequences are no longer interpreted by default.

- UI Toolkit: UI Toolkit Event Debugger is now Experimental. \[POI: RND-502: UI-15 / UIT-1705\].
