5.5.0b10 Release Notes (Full)
-----------------------------

### Features

*   Animation: Animation Window Box tool
*   Editor: New selection highlighting in scene view. Instead of showing a wireframe a selection outline is now shown. This outline color can be configured in the preferences of Unity. In the gizmo / annotation window you can select if you would like this behavour, the old behaviour, or both.
*   Editor: Option to run Cache Server locally for quick platform switching
*   Graphics: Add linear rendering on Android with OpenGL ES 3.x and iOS with Metal.
*   Graphics: New Unity splash screen and associated tools. Improvements/changes will be forthcoming during the beta period.
*   Particles: New Modules:
    *   Lights Module, for adding realtime lights to particles
    *   Noise Module, for adding Curl Noise to Particle Movement
    *   Trails Module, for rendering ribbonized trails behind particles
*   Physics: New CapsuleCollider2D
*   Platform: HoloLens support from the Technical Preview has now landed in mainline Unity. Several improvements will be forthcoming during the beta period.
*   Scripting: Built-in support for opening scripts in Visual Studio Code as an external script editor on OSX and Windows. Unity will now detect when Visual Studio Code is selected an external script editor and pass the correct arguments to it when opening scripts from Unity and setup a default .vscode/settings.json with file excludes, if it does not already exist.
*   Shaders: Per-rendertarget blend modes. New shader syntax: "Blend N Src Dst", "BlendOp N Op", "ColorMask Mask N", where N is the render target index (0..7). This feature works on DX11/12, GLCore, Metal, PS4.
*   VR: Holographic Emulation

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   DX9: DX9 half-pixel offset adjustments are now done at shader compilation time. This means that shaders no longer need to do any UNITY\_HALF\_TEXEL\_OFFSET checks, and any possible C# code for coordinate adjustment no longer needs to happen on DX9. However, vertex shader constant register #255 (c255) is reserved by Unity now, and all vertex shaders get two instructions automatically added to do the adjustment.
*   Editor: Time.deltaTime now updates in the editor for any script marked with \[ExecuteInEditMode\] or any MonoBehaviour that has runInEditMode set to true
*   JSONUtility: EditorJsonUtility now serializes object references by assetGUID/fileID rather than InstanceID, making the serialized data stable across Editor sessions
*   OpenGL: Legacy desktop OpenGL2 support was removed. It was already not the default in 5.3, and deprecated in 5.4. This only affects Mac & Linux.
*   WebGL: WebGL no longer supports loading LZMA compressed AssetBundles, as that is very inefficient - it's use was alway discouraged, but is now disabled

### Changes

*   Android: IL2CPP - Use Android NDK x64 on x64 Windows Editor
*   BuildPlayer: Building of a player will fail if the project does not build in the editor
*   Core: Changed the obsoleteness warning message of Undo.RegisterUndo to suggest the correct replacement.
*   Editor: Added support for resizing the height of the preferences window
*   Editor: Enabled redo for selection changes.
*   Editor: It's not allowed to build in linear color space on platforms that don't support it.
*   Editor: Reflection Probe: Renamed "Probe Origin" to "Box Offset" and "Size" to "Box Size" in the Inspector UI
*   Editor: Removed fading/lerping behaviour when dragging/docking views because it was ugly at best, and sometimes visually confusing.
*   Graphics: Add a fatal error if the player is force-run with a renderer that it wasn't built for from the editor.
*   Graphics: Default uncompressed texture format is RGBA32 on all platforms (this is default format for "new Texture2D" script API too). Previously, default was ARGB32 on some platforms, but RGBA32 is just better everywhere, as it needs less color channel swizzling at texture upload time.
*   Graphics: Removed logic that tried to downscale shadow resolution based on a guess on how much free VRAM was available at the time.
*   Graphics: Rendering Path settings have been moved from Project Settings -> Player to Project Settings -> Graphics.
*   Graphics: Updated shader macros to support lod + sampler variations for texture cubes and arrays.
*   Graphics: Warnings are shown when a renderer that statically batched is going to be rendered instanced.
*   HoloLens: HoloLens low latency API has been re-instated.
*   Physics: Expose Physics.queriesHitBackfaces. Off by default, so all physics queries would NOT detect hits with backface triangles. Previously, some queries would detect, and some wouldn't, which was inconsistent.
*   Physics: The breakForce reported by the OnJointBreak callback will now be the original breakForce, regardless of the Joint was disabled and re-enabled during the callback cycle
*   Physics: The Physics system will now reject meshes containing non-finite vertices
*   Samsung TV: Support for 2013 and 2014 TVs has been dropped. Deploying to these two years of TV will no longer work.
*   Shadows: Unity does not reduce shadowMap size automaticaly from VRAM anymore.
*   WebGL: Will now write asm.js code in separate file for normal js, which allows for better memory optimizations in Firefox

### Improvements

*   Android: IL2CPP - Full debug version of IL2CPP libraries are stored in Temp/StagingArea/Il2Cpp/Native
*   Android: IL2CPP - Stripping of symbols and debug info is now enabled by default. Development builds still has symbols which makes for a slightly larger binary
*   Android: SoftInput - Get rid of hardcoded text color, switch to Light theme
*   Android: Symbols for release libraries are now available in PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Variantions/\*/Release/Symbols
*   Animation: Added a new default ClipAnimationMaskType to the animation importer: None. This value should be used when you do not need a mask
*   Animation: Implemented Reset for BlendTrees.
*   Animation: Import avatar improvements: A warning is now degenerated when importing avatar configurations with hierarchies that do not match properly. These configurations will continue to work, but do need to be updated with a proper avatar configuration. This update also includes improvements to the default auto-mapping.
*   Animation: In the Clip Importer, AvatarMask will be now set to None by default when importing new FBX files
*   Build Pipeline: Optimized the build pipeline so that asset bundles that contain scene files don't have to recompile the scripts every time. This results in a much quicker build process.
*   Cache Server: Upgraded the node.js version used by the Cache Server to version 0.12.7
*   DX9: Fixed various half-pixel offset issues when using Direct3D 9. Now rendering matches other platforms (DX11, OpenGL etc.) exactly.
*   Editor: Add Unity version to main editor window title bar (makes it easy to see which Unity version you currently have open)
*   Editor: Added 'Discard changes' in scene context menu in the Hierarchy: Reloads selected modified scenes from disk
*   Editor: Area lights now indicate their effective range in the inspector.
*   Editor: EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent now adds type information to the text string as shown for ObjectFields: E.g: "Concrete (Texture2D)" instead "Concrete".
*   Editor: Game View now has the option emulate low-resolution for aspect ratios when on a retina monitor. There is a checkbox at the top of the Aspect Ratio/Resolution menu. (macOS-only, since retina support is currently macOS-only)
*   Editor: In SceneView, hide wireframe on objects with the hideInHierarchy flag (previously it would show when the object's parent was selected).
*   Editor: It is now possible to dock views to the tops of windows and other views. Previously only left, right and bottom were possible.
*   Editor: Undo support for Sorting Layers
*   Editor: Unity now treats quotes in the .exe path as the Windows command line does.
*   Editor: Windows Editor will now remember the directory where a project was last created, and it will default to that location rather than the directory of the last opened project
*   Game Performance: Added option to prevent exceptions occurring Play mode in the editor from being reported to the Game Performance service.
*   GI: Pass custom properties when rendering GI meta pass.
*   Graphics: Added cubemap arrays support (CubemapArray C# class). Similar to Texture2DArray, this is a graphics feature that lets the GPU to access a bunch of same size/format cubemaps as a unit, index into them when sampling etc. Cubemap arrays are a desktop/console class feature, supported on DX10.1+/GL4.0+ on PC, and on PS4/XB1.
*   Graphics: Added RenderTexture.GenerateMips script API for manual control over mipmap generation. Renamed existing RenderTexture.generateMips property to autoGenerateMips.
*   Graphics: Added support for BC4/BC5 texture formats on PC and consoles. The new formats are available in texture import format override options (they are not used by default), or when creating textures from scripts.
*   Graphics: Added support for importing textures as RGBAHalf (16 bits float per component)
    *   Added 'HDR' texture format for automatic HDR format choice (RGBAHalf for Desktop/PS4/XBoxOne and the usual RGBM, dLDR depending on the platform)
    *   Reflection probes now default to this new HDR format
*   Graphics: Added Texture conversion to RenderTargetIdentifier so that SetGlobalTexture actually accepts textures.
*   Graphics: Added the ability of batching renderers of different LOD fade values together by using "lodfade" option in instancing\_options directive.
*   Graphics: Faster static batch rendering using fewer draw calls.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added support for Android with OpenGL ES 3.0 or newer. Note however that GPU instancing support is disabled for Android devices that have the Adreno GPU with only OpenGL ES 3.0, because of driver issues.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added support for Metal.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: For statically batched MeshRenderers, using instanced shader now will not break static batching. If you want renderers to be instancing batched, please consider disable static batching flag.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Implemented SpeedTree instancing
    *   Still light probes are not allowed.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: It is no longer an error to use instanced shaders on renderers that don't support instancing (SkinnedMeshRenderer, SpriteRenderer, etc.).
*   Graphics: Improved in-editor graphics emulation:
    *   Metal setting added, used by default on iOS/tvOS (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
    *   OpenGL ES 3.0 setting added, used by default on Android (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
    *   WebGL 1 and WebGL 2 settings added; WebGL1 used by default on WebGL (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
    *   Shader Model 4 setting added, available on Standalone/WindowsStore.
*   Graphics: Improved LODGroup component UI:
    *   Now the sliding Camera icon is aware of the global LOD bias value and works acoordingly.
    *   The "Recalculate Bounds" button now only gets enabled when clicking it has a change.
*   Graphics: Line/Trail Renderer rendering has been improved.
*   Graphics: Metal (iOS/macOS) can render into slices of 3D and 2DArray textures now.
*   Graphics: Metal: Switched the shader backend to HLSLcc.
*   Graphics: Multi-scene occlusion culling now works correctly. Culling data has been extracted to a separate asset, and can be baked / reloaded with multi-scene setups. Note that the data is stored relative to the active scene, and is loaded correctly when loading any scene or group of scenes that reference it.
*   Graphics: Shader.globalMaximumLOD is now restored after exiting playmode.
*   Graphics: Textures can now be imported to two new formats:
    *   BC6H for high quality compressed RGB HDR textures
    *   BC7 for high quality compressed RGB(A) textures Those formats are currently only available on desktop (DX11+, GLCore), PS4 and Xbox One platforms.
    *   On those platforms, HDR textures will now default to FP16 for uncompressed texture and BC6H for compressed textures.
    *   Reflection probes behave the same way (uncompressed => FP16, compressed => BC6H)
    *   BC7 will be chosen automatically by the texture importer for texture setup as "High Quality Compressed" on supported platforms (see texture importer refactoring)
    *   Note: DX9 and MacGL do not support those formats. If a texture is set as BC6H it will be automatically uncompressed to FP16 and BC7 will be uncompressed to RGBA8
*   Graphics: Visualize command buffers attached to Lights, add buttons for removing each/all of them
*   HoloLens: The builtin spatial mapping occlusion shader has been optimized, thus provides higher frame rates.
*   HoloLens: The tracking loss screen now renders at ~60 FPS (previously ~40 FPS).
*   HoloLens: The Visual Tracking Loss Screen will now always be displayed when visual tracking has been lost.
*   IL2CPP: Reduce the binary size and build time for projects which make use of many C# attributes.
*   IMGUI: Event.Use() method logs a warning if event type is Repaint or Layout
*   iOS: Added a way for the user to retrieve Game Center authentication error strings.

*   iOS/tvOS: Significantly reduce the size of shipped static libraries
*   iOS/tvOS: Use relative symlinks for plugins when building to related folder
*   JSONUtility: EditorJsonUtility now allows any object type to be passed in for serialization, not just UnityEngine.Object types, so that vanilla C# types can take advantage of the object reference serialization behaviour.
*   JsonUtility: JsonUtility.ToJson is now faster and uses less temporary memory.
*   Lines: Added a Texture Mode to the Line/Trail renderers, to control whether the texture repeats or stretches.
*   Occlusion Culling: Unity now supports multi-scene occlusion culling. Scenes built concurrently will be computed as expected.
*   OSX/iOS Metal: Add -force-metal switch to force Metal rendering on OSX/iOS
*   Particles: Added 'Show Bounds' to Particle System UI. Shows the world and local AABB for the system.
*   Particles: Added new option to rotate particles to face their initial direction of travel
*   Particles: Added new render mode to make particle billboards face the eye position (good for VR)
*   Particles: Gradients now support a fixed color mode, where no blending is performed. Useful when users want to define a simple list of possible colors to be chosen from.
*   Particles: Gravity Modifier can now be a curve over time
*   Particles: Improved the Particle System curve editor: it now supports wrap modes and improved selection and editing of keys.
*   Particles: Support for sending custom data to Particle System Vertex Shaders

*   Physics: Update from PhysX 3.3.1 to PhysX 3.3.3
*   Player: Allow asset bundles to work with engine code stripping. A custom player build can understand which asset bundles will be loaded by the player at run time and determine which parts of the engine code those asset bundles need to preserve. See BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer method change.
*   Plugins: You can exclude specific platforms when "Any Platform" is selected, this allows you to set compatibilities as "Plugin is compatible on any platform except this specific platform". Added additional API to PluginImporter.
*   SamsungTV: Support for deploying to multiple TVs at once by separating TV IPs with a forward slash.
*   Scripting: Editor on OSX will no longer start BugReporter with mono NULL exception if -batchmode
*   Scripting: Improve performance System.IO.StringReader.ReadLine
*   Scripting: Upgrade C# compiler to Mono 4.4. The new compiler still targets C# 4 and .Net 3.5, but provides better performance and many bug fixes.

*   Shaders: Improved memory usage for large shaders compiled for multiple APIs. Only the active API's data will be decompressed in the player.
*   Shaders: Improved usability of "Show compiled code" for shaders. Now compiled shader variants are grouped together in a more useful way.
*   Shaders: Increased amount of allowed shader keywords to 256 (up from 128). Optimized related parts of the code, so it's often actually faster now.
*   Shaders: Material UI displays render queue setting. Previously this was a script-only setting on the material.
*   Shaders: Renamed variables and cleaned code in UnityStandardBRDF.cginc
*   Shaders: Shaders are now exported to player completely in binary - no shader text string and parsing in the runtime.
*   Shaders: When shader compilation fails and the reason is unknown show the error output from the platform shader compiler in the error message.
*   Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster (specifically, TerrainData.SetHeights and setting the size property are faster now).
*   Unity Ads: Updated Unity Ads to 2.0.4
*   Unity Ads: Updated Unity Ads to v2.0.5. Fixed crashes related to calling user-defined callbacks from outside the main Unity thread.
*   Version Control: Major improvements in memory and cpu usage
*   Visual Studio: Add cancel button to "Opening Visual Studio" progress dialog
*   VisualStudio: Stop using COM to launch VisualStudio for a better immediate feedback experience
*   VR: UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalRotation() and UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalPosition() can now be used to query the position and orientation of Oculus Touch and HTC Vive controllers.
*   VR: Updated the native plugin support for VR devices. Plugins in user projects override native VR plugins when used.
*   Web: The Accept-Encoding header may now be set via scripting, but note that this is done at users' risk.
*   WebGL: Option to use Brotli compression instead of Gzip
*   WebGL: Rebuilds which don't change code now cache complete JS build, resulting in much faster iteration times
*   WebGL: Reduced the size of release builds by stripping away duplicate functions.
*   WebGL: WebGL 2.0 is now enabled by default for new projects
*   Windows Standalone: Add option "Copy PDB files" in build settings window which controls copying of pdb files when building to Windows Standalone
*   Windows Standalone: Application can now correctly run in low integrity mode. (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625960.aspx)
*   Windows Store: Added "Copy References" option in build settings window, this will allow for generated solution to reference Unity files from Unity installation folder instead of copying them to exported folder, this can save up to 10 GB of disk space, the downside is, you can't copy exported folder to other PC, because there will be a dependency towards Unity's installation folder.
*   Windows Store: Added a concept of "target device type", which allows you to target only one family of devices, e.g. PC, mobile or HoloLens, enabling better resource optimization for a particular device type. See documentation of EditorUserBuildSettings.wsaSubtarget for more information
*   Windows Store: Assembly C# projects are now generated next to the main solution (in the GeneratedProjects folder).
*   Windows Store: Expand UnityEngine.WSA.Cursor.SetCustomCursor, if you pass 0 to this function, it will restore the cursor to arror icon
*   Windows Store: New implementation for TouchScreenKeyboard on UWP, now supports both XAML and D3D apps as well as IME input. Older implementation can be turned on by passing command line argument -forceTextBoxBasedKeyboard.
*   Windows Store: New option for input handling in XAML-based applications: receive poinater input from SwapChainPanel (alternative to independent input source)
*   Windows Store: Partial hardware cursor support, default cursor set in PlayerSettings will act as a hardware cursor, cursors set at runtime will act as software cursors like it was before, more information in Cursor documentation.
*   Windows Store: Windows Store platform will not show in build settings window if Editor is ran not on Windows

*   HoloLens: Spatial mapping component API changes:
    1.  The "Custom Render Setting" property is now "Render State".
    2.  The "Custom Material" render setting is now "Visualization".
    3.  "Custom Material" is now "Visual Material".
    4.  "volume" property is now "volumeType".
    5.  "sphereRadiusMeters" is now "sphereRadius".
    6.  "boxExtentsMeters" is now "halfBoxExtents".
    7.  "lod" is now "lodType".
*   JSONUtility: EditorJsonUtility methods now accept any object type, not only UnityEngine.Object subclasses
*   Particles: Added IsEmitting property.
*   Particles: Fully exposed main particle properties to script
*   Particles: Particles Stop function now takes an enum to stop emitting or stop emitting and clear.
*   Physics: PlatformEffector2D now has a 'rotationalOffset' property to adjust the local 'up' (surface) vector.
*   Physics: Rigidbody2D component now has a 'bodyType' property that allows selection of Dynamic, Kinematic or Static bodies.
*   Physics: The following properties have been renamed:
    *   Physics.solverIterationCount to Physics.defaultSolverIterations
    *   Physics.solverVelocityIterationCount to Physics.defaultSolverVelocityIterations
    *   Rigidbody.solverIterationCount to Rigidbody.solverIterations
    *   Rigidbody.solverVelocityIterationCount to Rigidbody.solverVelocityIterations
*   Physics2D: Physics2D.CapsuleCast and Physics2D.OverlapCapsule API.
*   Profiler: Profiler class moved from UnityEngine namespace to UnityEngine.Profiling
*   Scene: Added SceneUtility class with scene path to build index conversion methods and added SceneManager.GetSceneByBuildIndex.
*   SceneManager: Added UnloadSceneAsync API which can be called anytime unlike UnloadScene.
*   SceneManager: UnloadScene has now be marked deprecated and will throw an exception if called at illegal times. UnloadSceneAsync should be used instead (762371)
*   Scripting: Add disposable scope helper for Begin/EndChangeCheck
*   Scripting: Add missing generic overloads for Object.Instantiate
*   Scripting: Introduced global define UNITY\_5\_5\_OR\_NEWER, which can be used for conditionally compile code that is compatible only with Unity 5.5 or newer
*   Shadows: Exposed LightShadowResolution enum to scripts. (575369)
*   Substance: A FreezeAndReleaseSourceData() method was added to the ProceduralMaterial class. This renders the ProceduralMaterial immutable and releases some of the underlying data to decrease the memory footprint. To release even more of the underlying data, it is necessary to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() afterwards. Once frozen, the ProceduralMaterial cannot be cloned, its ProceduralTextures cannot be rebuilt, nor its inputs be set.
*   Terrain: Added Terrain.SetSplatMaterialPropertyBlock and Terrain.GetSplatMaterialPropertyBlock API that allows per-terrain shader properties to be used for rendering the terrain.
*   Terrain: Added Terrain.treeLODBiasMultiplier for adjusting LOD bias for SpeedTree trees.
*   Terrain: Added TerrainChangedFlags for use with the OnTerrainChanged message.
*   Terrain: Added TerrainData.bounds for retrieving the local bounding box of terrain heightmap data.
*   Tizen: Add UnityEngine.Tizen.Window.evasGL to retrieve a pointer to the native Evas\_GL object used by Unity to render.
*   UI: Added rootCanvas property to Canvas. (782957)
