## Release Notes

### Improvements

-   Graphics: Added support for feature level 11.1 on D3D11/D3D12. This brings native support for RGB565 and ARGB1555 RenderTexture formats. Note that this does not render correctly for ARGB4444 which will be fixed in one of the future releases.
-   Graphics: An error message is shown in the console for platforms that don\'t support linear color space rendering with OpenGL ES. (757055)
-   macOS/iOS/tvOS: Allow using Xcode\'s manual signing workflow by specifying a provisioning profile in Player Settings.
-   Metal: Improved handling of transparent rendering after post-opaque image effects when using MSAA.
-   Shaders: If an unknown/unhandled error occurs during shader compilation, append it to the shader compiler error message. This gives some context on what might be wrong in the shader.
-   Shaders: Optimized in-editor import, load time and memory usage for shaders with massive amounts of potential variants.
-   Unity Ads: Updated native binaries to version 2.0.6.

### Changes

-   Test Runner: Removed script templates for test runner (as it is not released). (855550)
-   Editor: Fix for an editor crash when switching platforms on a command line build shipped in 5.5.0p4 has been backed out as it requires further tests. This issue will be fixed in a future version (859350).

### Known Issues

-   Ads: Engine integrated Ads fails to load on iOS builds published to Apple App Store ([874227](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/874227/)). Workaround is to use Asset Store package[Unity Ads 2.0](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/66123). This will be fixed as soon as possible.
-   iOS: Unity splash screen doesn\'t show up on iOS builds (856772). This will be fixed in a future patch release.
-   Warning about missing object references in the inspector after upgraded to 5.5. We have only received one bug report and we have not been able to reproduce the issue. If you find some/all of your object references missing in the inspector do not save your scene. Quit the editor and re-open your project and the references should come back correctly.
