### Improvements

*   Shaders: During shader compilation if an unknown/unhandled error occurs append the unknown/unhandled error message to the shader compiler error message. This gives some context on what might be wrong in the shader.

### Fixes

*   (none) - Ads: Fixed cloud build issue.
*   (835453) - Android: First scene is now loaded asynchronously while the splash screen is displayed.
