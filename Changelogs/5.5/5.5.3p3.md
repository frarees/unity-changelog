### Improvements

*   Asset Bundles: Reduced SerializedFile memory usage when reading streams inside AssetBundles.
*   Build Pipeline: Exceptions thrown during the build process (e.g. by user callbacks) will now be treated the same as logged errors, from a reporting and StrictMode point of view.
*   Graphics: Added function to allow cube map textures to be compressed from script like their Texture2D counterparts
