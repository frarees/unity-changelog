### 2023.2.7f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- iOS: Add Apple Privacy Manifest support.



#### Improvements

- URP: Enable renderViewportScale for XR intermediate textures.



#### Changes

- Burst: Update default LLVM to version 16



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed issue where a SpriteShapeRenderer with mask interaction set is unable to be masked by a SpriteMask when using a URP pipeline.
    ([UUM-59737](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-mask-is-not-masking-sprites-when-using-spriteshape))

- 2D: Fixed local bounds of 2D Freeform Light from changing when scene is reloaded.
    ([UUM-49000](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/local-bounds-values-of-2d-freeform-light-change-when-the-scene-is-reloaded))

- Android: Updated GetEngineGradleDependencies\(\) API to return asset pack dependencies.
    (UUM-21692)

- Animation: Fixed erroneous discrete int and enum default values written back by the Animator.
    ([UUM-58573](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-enum-properties-get-set-to-0-instead-of-the-value-specified-in-the-scene-when-the-property-is-animated-by-a-state-that-is-not-playing))

- Audio: Fixed AudioMixer clicks when abruptly changing volume in Start\(\).
    ([UUM-368](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-plays-for-a-split-second-when-mixers-volume-is-set-to-0-beforehand))

- Burst: Burst recompiles assemblies due to hashes mismatching because of the way assembly defines are combined into the hash.

- Burst: Fixed an issue where underflows of nint and nuint at compile time would lead to incorrect code.

- Burst: Fixed an issue where use of certain intrinsics could cause a compile error even if properly guarded by the appropriate `IsXXXSupported` property.

- Burst: Fixed android builds throwing a NullReferenceException.

- Burst: Fixed arithmetic and bitwise negation on native integers.

- Burst: Fixed burst not differentiating between overloaded generic functions such as T foo\(int val\) and T foo\(T val\) when the function calls are foo\(1\); foo&lt;int&gt;\(1\). Burst would previously only compile the T foo\(T val\) function.

- Burst: Fixed constant SHUFFLE function not seen as a constant when called indirectly through a `FunctionPointer`.

- Burst: Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions `cvt_ss2si`, `cvtss_si32`, and `cvtss_si64` to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.

- Burst: If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted.  In order to fix this \( editor only - player builds are unaffected\), we now save some additional context on each entry point.

- Editor: Editor crash if a compilation error happened during import from code altering compilation assets during activate.

    ([UUM-58570](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/multiple-enum-flags-not-rendering-correctly-in-the-editor-when-custom-propertydrawer-values-are-changed))

- Editor: Fixed memory corruption when closing aux window when dialog box shows up.
    ([UUM-53154](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-crash-on-guiview-sendlayoutevent-or-idlist-calculatenextfromhintlist-when-browsing-for-a-visual-graph-and-selecting-none))
