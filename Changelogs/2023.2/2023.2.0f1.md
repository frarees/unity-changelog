#### Features

- 2D: Added overlay support to the Tile Palette window.

- Accessibility: Added a new Editor window that displays the active accessibility hierarchy and its nodes.

- Android: Added the Addressables for Android \(com.unity.addressables.android\) package. This package provides Play Asset Delivery support for Addressables.

- Audio: Added a new AudioRandomContainer asset which lets a user quickly set up a playlist that can be randomized in different ways, with different ways of triggering the sounds. It is useful for most sound use cases, such as footsteps, impacts, weapons, and props. An AudioRandomContainer is played through an AudioSource.

- Audio: Added a VU meter to the audio random container.

- DX12: Added Native Render Pass support for DX12.

- DX12: Added support for building ray tracing acceleration structures asynchronously on a compute queue. AsyncCompute CommandBuffers can now run `CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure` commands. Added support for RayTracingAccelerationStructure to RenderGraph and Render Graph Viewer.

- DX12: Enabled exposing raytracing acceleration structure build flags for balancing build times versus ray tracing speed and memory consumption on the GPU. The flags can be customized from C\# when creating and building a RayTracingAccelerationStructure and from UI in Renderer settings.

- Editor: Added a Context Menu to the Scene view.

- Editor: Added a new tool for light placement using the pan, zoom, and orbit controls of the Camera.

- Editor: Added a `PropertyCollectionAttribute` that can be used to implement custom drawers for collections.

    - Repeat x runs the test x amount of times or until it fails. This is useful for testing unstable tests.<br>
    - Retry x if a test fails. This run the test x amount of times or until it succeeds.

- Editor: Enabled users to specify browser type and executable path for WebGL platform tests.

- Editor: Enabled using the new C\# baking API for implementing a new function to bake APV independently from lightmaps or reflection probes. This PR refactors some of the APV baking functions to enable the use of this new C\# baking API.

- Accessibility: Changed: Types in the `UnityEngine.Accessibility` namespace are now hosted in a separate `UnityEngine.AccessibilityModule` assembly. Managed plug-ins referencing the `UnityEngine` assembly containing type forwarders won't be affected, but if the `UnityEngine.CoreModule` was referenced directly to access these type, then this is a breaking change.

- AI: Added: New methods in the `NavMesh` class to manage the state of Link instances: `IsLinkActive()`, `SetLinkActive()`, `GetLinkOwner()`, `SetLinkOwner()`, `IsLinkValid()` and `IsLinkOccupied()`.

- AI: Added: New `OffMeshLinkData.owner` property that references either an object assigned to a Link with `NavMesh.SetLinkOwner()`, or an `OffMeshLink` component that created the link.

- AI: Deprecated: The experimental `NavMeshQuery` struct has been deprecated along with all the other types from the `UnityEngine.Experimental.AI` namespace. We've identified issues with them that require the API to be redesigned.

- AI: Deprecated: The members of the `NavMeshLinkInstance` struct have been deprecated and replaced with methods in the NavMesh class.

- AI: Deprecated: The `OffMeshLink` component and its members have been deprecated. Use \[NavMeshLink\]\(https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/NavMeshLink.html\) instead.

- AI: Deprecated: `OffMeshLinkData.offMeshLink` has been deprecated in favor of the new `OffMeshLinkData.owner` property.

- Android: Deprecated: Deprecate OnPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject in favor of OnModifyAndroidProjectFiles.

- Android: Deprecated: The keystorePass and keyaliasPass properties in PlayerSettings class have been deprecated, use the ones from PlayerSettings.Android class.

- Android: Obsoleted: Removed ETC2 decompression fallback from Android BuildSettings and made the related scripting API obsolete. The feature had no effect since OpenGL ES 2.0 support was removed.

- Animation: Added: ClearKeys and CopyFromAPI in AnimationCurve.
    ([UUM-20456](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-volume-curves-have-impact-even-if-they-are-disabled), [UUM-20458](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-revert-property-doesnt-work-on-curves))

- Apple TV: Added: Added identifier for 3rd generation Apple TV 4K.

- Core: Added: Overload to NativeArrayUnsafeUtility.ConvertExistingDataToNativeArray which takes a Span as input.

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` returns the maximum number of job workers that can work on a job at the same time. The job system will create a number of job worker threads that will be no greater than the number of logical CPU cores for the platform. However, since arbitrary threads can execute jobs via work stealing we allocate extra workers which act as temporary job worker threads. `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` reflects the maximum number of job worker threads<br>
    plus temporary workers the job system will ever use. As such, this value is useful for allocating buffers which should be subdivided evenly between job workers since `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` and `NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute` will never return a value greater than `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`.
    (UUM-29945)

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` returns the index for the current thread when executing a job, otherwise 0. When multiple threads are working on a parallel job at once, no two threads will have the same index. The range is \[0, `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`\). The value returned when called from within a job is the same as the one stored in a job member decorated with `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute`, otherwise 0.

    ([UUM-17373](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-renderer-displays-a-warning-when-attempting-to-use-urp-shaders))

- Editor: Changed: TextureCompression Preference to be an Editor User Setting and obsolete the Unsupported APIs : GetApplicationSettingCompressAssetsOnImport and SetApplicationSettingCompressAssetsOnImport.

- Editor: Deprecated: ObjectIdResult.DecodeIdFromColor. Users are now encouraged to use HandleUtility.DecodeSelectionId for decoding and HandleUtility.EncodeSelectionId for encoding selection IDs.

- Editor: Deprecated: The property ChildCount on HierarchyNodeFlattened was renamed to ChildrenCount.<br>
    The following methods are now deprecated: GetExpanded replaced by DoesNotHaveFlags\(Collapsed\), GetSelected replaced by HasFlags\(Selected\), SetExpanded replaced by ClearFlags\(Collapsed\), and SetSelected replaced by SetFlags\(Selected\).

- Editor: Deprecated: `CameraEditor.CreatePreviewOverlay` as the camera preview overlay is now replaced by the new Cameras Overlay \(accessible from the Overlays menu with ~\) in the SceneView.

- Editor: Removed: AssetDatabase.RefreshDelayed\(\) method has been removed.

- Graphics: Added: `TextureImporterPlatformSettings.ignorePlatformSupport` to bypass platform format checks.

- Graphics: Changed: Added a new read-only `Light.dilatedRange` member. Before this addition, for area lights, if you set `Light.range`, and then immediately read it back, it would return a different value. This is because area lights have a larger effective range since the source is an area, and not a single point. Now, the `Light.range` always returns the same value you set, and the newly added `Light.dilatedRange` returns the range dilated to account for the area size.

- Graphics: Changed: Deprecated `Area` in favor of `Rectangle` in the `LightType` enum. Added `Box`, `Pyramid`, and `Tube` members to the same enum.

- Graphics: Changed: Rename ISRPGraphicsSettings to IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings.

- Graphics: Deprecated: RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance method for adding AABB ray tracing instances. An alternative method can be used that takes a structure with all the method parameters instead.

- Graphics: Deprecated: `Light.shape`. This information is now unified into `Light.type`.

- HDRP: Deprecated: `HDLightType`, `HDLightTypeAndShape`, `SpotLightShape`, and `AreaLightShape`. HDRP directly uses Light.type in native Unity, and handles the upgrade automatically.

- HDRP: Obsoleted: Marked RenderPipelineSettings.supportDitheringCrossFade obsolete.

    New classes and structs to support new functionality: several new enumerables, such as HierarchyFlattenedNodeChildren, HierarchyNodeChildren and HierarchyViewNodesEnumerable.<br>
    A new enum flags HierarchyNodeFlags used by the HierarchyViewModel.<br>
    A new struct HierarchyNodeMapUnmanaged to store unmanaged data per node that is O\(1\) lookup time, implemented as a sparse array.

- Scripting: Changed: Several methods have had their parameter taking a Span changed to a ReadOnlySpan, to indicate that the content of the span will not be modified and only used as input.<br>
    Hierarchy.RegisterNodeTypeHandler now returns the handler.<br>
    The Hierarchy.SortChildren method got a new parameter, to enable sorting recursively.

- Scripting: Deprecated: PrefabUtilitiy.InstantiateAttachedAsset is deprecated.
    ([UUM-33714](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-typeinfo-for-noncopyable-when-copying-and-pasting-a-nested-prefab-variant))

- GI: Changed the Lighting Visualization panel's **Lighting Mode** property from a checkbox toggle to a drop-down menu.

- GI: Disabled automatic baking of environment lighting. To bake environment lighting, use the **Generate Lighting** button in the Lighting Window, or use **Auto Generate Lighting** mode. Scenes that have not been baked will use a default skybox cubemap and ambient probe which matches the default skybox.

- GI: Moved the **Recalculate Environment Lighting** setting to **Project Settings** &gt; **Editor**. This setting was previously in the **Lighting Window** &gt; **Workflow**.

- GI: Moved the toggle for displaying lightmap resolution in scene view modes to a panel that is displayed when the relevant modes are active.

- GI: Removed **Recalculate Environment Lighting** project setting.

- GI: Removed erroneous mentions of **Auto Generate Lighting** from the documentation, because this mode no longer exists.

    ([UUM-741](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-2xmsaa-does-not-work-on-mali-devices-when-post-processing-is-enabled))

- UI Toolkit: Changed Event propagation rules for `ExecuteDefaultAction`, `ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget`, and `PreventDefault`:<br>
    - Calling `StopPropagation()` on an event will now also prevent `ExecuteDefaultAction` and `ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget` from being called.<br>
    - Calling `PreventDefault()` will behave like calling both `StopPropagation` and `focusController.IgnoreEvent`, so it will also stop execution of the registered callbacks further down the propagation path.<br>
    - Both `ExecuteDefaultAction` and `ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget` are now executed in-between registered callbacks during the BubbleUp phase, immediately before any callback on the current target.<br>
    - All standard control event handling was moved to registered event callbacks or `HandleEventBubbleUp` overrides, and can be prevented by calling `StopPropagation` during the `TrickleDown` phase. This includes triggering the Contextual menu. The exception to this rule is behavior that's part of an event's PostDispatch method, which includes switching focus on Pointer down or navigation.<br>
    - It is strongly recommended to replace `ExecuteDefaultAction` and `ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget` overrides for a `HandleEventBubbleUp` override instead, and `PreventDefault` for `StopPropagation`.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the **Display** label on an interactive element.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the Event propagation rules for composite roots, making them behave more similarly to regular elements.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the Event propagation rules for Mouse compatibility events:<br>
    - Mouse compatibility events are now dispatched alongside the Pointer event associated with them, immediately following them during each step of the TrickleDown and BubbleUp propagation phases.<br>
    - Calling StopPropagation on either the pointer event or its associated compatibility mouse event will now stop the propagation of both events after the current propagation step is completed.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the number of FocusEvents and BlurEvents sent when changing a focused element if the target has at least one composite root parent.

- UI Toolkit: Removed the prevention of compatibility mouse events when cancelling PointerDownEvent.

- Universal RP: Disabled the ability for decals to enqueue passes when running on unsupported APIs, such as OpenGL or GLES3, instead of displaying the magenta error.

- Universal RP: Enabled deferred renderer to now use Framebuffer Fetch for Shadowmask.

- Universal Windows Platform: Updated the system requirements for the Universal Windows Platform Player to Windows 10 Version 21H1 \(build 19043\).

- URP: Added support for Vulkan URP to use MSAA samples count fallback in the Player Settings window. Prior to this x2 fallback would have been to upgrade to x4.
    ([UUM-741](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-2xmsaa-does-not-work-on-mali-devices-when-post-processing-is-enabled))
