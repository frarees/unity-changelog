### New 2023.2.0a22 Entries since 2023.2.0a20

#### Features

- Graphics: Added support for GPU batched skinning for D3D12 \(Windows and XBox platforms\).

- Test Framework: Added TestFileReferences.json to be generated on build step of the player, so can be consumed later by Test runners to enrich data for run part.

- Test Framework: By using the editor command line new argument -randomOrderSeed x you can run the tests in a randomized order, where x is an integer different from 0. If a new test is added in the project the random order passing the same seed will be kept, and the new test will be placed in the random list accordigly.

- Test Framework: The UTF version now automatically updates for SRP tests.



#### Improvements

- Burst: Added proper license attribution for MUSL and SLEEF libraries.

- Editor: Ignore managed plugins in the project, when scanning for monoscriptinfo for script assets.

- Editor: The audio mute button in the game view toolbar uses less time per frame.

- Editor: The Editor Console's rendering now doesn't scale in the number of log entries anymore.

- Graphics: Experimental.Rendering.ExternalGPUProfiler now supports XCode FrameCapture.

- IL2CPP: Added windows arm64 build of il2cpp and UnityLinker.<br>
    https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/il2cpp/pull/5317.

- IL2CPP: Optimize field marking logic in UnityLinker to reduce runtime.  Impact varies by project.  Some are 1% others could see more than 36% reduction in runtime.<br>
    https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/il2cpp/pull/5308.

- Mono: Added logging that will now list the threads that are being waited on during a domain reload.<br>

Managed plug-ins referencing the `UnityEngine` assembly containing type forwarders won't be affected, but if the `UnityEngine.CoreModule` was referenced directly to access these type, then this is a breaking change.

- AI: Deprecated: The experimental `NavMeshQuery` struct has been deprecated along with all the other types from the `UnityEngine.Experimental.AI` namespace. We've identified issues with them that require the API to be redesigned.

- Editor: Changed: Changed SpriteRenderer warning relating to a missing _MainTex to instead relate to missing a _BaseMap or _MainTex.

### Preview of Final 2023.2.0a22 Release Notes

#### Features

- 2D: Added overlay support to the Tile Palette window.

- Audio: Added a new AudioRandomContainer asset which lets a user quickly set up a playlist that can be randomized in different ways, with different ways of triggering the sounds. It is useful for most sound use cases, such as footsteps, impacts, weapons, and props. An AudioRandomContainer is played through an AudioSource.

- Audio: Added a VU meter to the audio random container.

- DX12: Added Native Render Pass support for DX12.

- DX12: Added support for building ray tracing acceleration structures asynchronously on a compute queue. AsyncCompute CommandBuffers can now run `CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure` commands. Added support for RayTracingAccelerationStructure to RenderGraph and Render Graph Viewer.

- DX12: Enabled exposing raytracing acceleration structure build flags for balancing build times versus ray tracing speed and memory consumption on the GPU. The flags can be customized from C\# when creating and building a RayTracingAccelerationStructure and from UI in Renderer settings.

- Editor: Added a Context Menu to the Scene View.

- Editor: Added a new tool for light placement using the pan, zoom, and orbit controls of the Camera.

- Editor: Added a `PropertyCollectionAttribute` that can be used to implement custom drawers for collections.

- Editor: Added an option to Scene View preferences to only refresh the Scene view when the Editor is in focus.

- Editor: Added basic Emoji support.

- Editor: Added basic OpenType font feature support. Currently, only kerning is enabled.

- Editor: Added the ability to bind the keyboard shortcut for making transitions between Animator states.

- Editor: Added the Color Checker, which is a tool used to calibrate lighting and post process. The Color Checker is an object that the user can add through **GameObject** &gt; **Rendering** &gt; **Color Checker Tool**. The tool is meant only as a production tool for lighting artists and won't be saved in Build.

- Editor: Added the UI Toolkit data bindings feature to the Unity Editor, which includes data bindings support in UI Builder, Editor bindings workflow improvements, and UxmlObjects authoring workflows in UI Builder.

- Editor: Added UI Toolkit editor to the Camera component.

- Editor: Enabled retrying and repeating tests on test level. This means that as soon as the test finishes running the first iteration, Unity now retries or repeats it. Pass the command line arguments to the Editor:<br>
    - Repeat x runs the test x amount of times or until it fails. This is useful for testing unstable tests.<br>
    - Retry x if a test fails. This run the test x amount of times or until it succeeds.

- Editor: Enabled users to specify browser type and executable path for WebGL platform tests.

- Editor: Enabled using the new C\# baking API for implementing a new function to bake APV independently from lightmaps or reflection probes. This PR refactors some of the APV baking functions to enable the use of this new C\# baking API.

- Editor: Replaced most OS contextual menus with the UI Toolkit version.

- Graphics: Added mipmap limit support for Texture2DArrays.

- Graphics: Added mipmap stripping support for Texture2DArrays.

- Graphics: Added rendererPriority support for BatchRendererGroup.

- Graphics: Added support for GPU batched skinning for D3D12 \(Windows and XBox platforms\).

- Graphics: Added support for providing tiled EXR images to LoadImage.

- Graphics: Added `BatchCullingContext.cullingFlags` to specify whether lightmapped shadow casters should be culled.

- HDRP: Added a material type for thin objects with colored transmission.

- HDRP: Added a ShaderGraph output for a physically based sky and added controls to author a moon.

- HDRP: Added a visualization of async compute passes and their synchronization points to the Render Graph Viewer.

- HDRP: Added support for clustered decals in the HDRP path tracer.

- HDRP: Added support for shader graph decals to affect transparent objects.

- HDRP: Added the Global Pass API to allow injecting custom passes in the rendering without GameObjects in the scene.

- HDRP: Added the possibility for APV to stream data directly from the disk. This feature is limited to compute capable devices.

- HDRP: Added Volume Profile to HD Render Pipeline Asset.

- HDRP: Added volumetric fog fullscreen debug mode output for AOV.

- HDRP: Displayed an option to disable clear coat on the material for Lit ShaderGraphs.

- HDRP: Implemented beer shadow maps for volumetric clouds.

- License: Enabled the Unity Editor to show different license notification modals.

- Package: Removed a deprecated UnityAnalytics event from the Patch User Reporting SDK, and upgraded package dependencies and sample.

- Package Manager: Added **Services** as an entry in the Package Manager side bar.

- Package Manager: Added a new sidebar with a search field that is specific to sections in the Package Manager.

- Package Manager: Added contextual sign in buttons when users have imported assets from Asset Store packages.

- Package Manager: Added icons in the sidebar.

- Package Manager: Added individual scoped registries to the sidebar.

- Package Manager: Added support for legacy `.unitypackage` bulk updates and enabled removal when a user is not on the `My Assets` page.

- Package Manager: Added the ability to manage an imported .unitypackage from the Asset Store in **In Project**.

- Package Manager: Added Web3 as a Filter Category in My Assets.

- Package Manager: Changed the **Updates available** filter in the project so it now has its own context in the Package Manager.

- Package Manager: Implemented right-clicking on documentation/changelog/licenses button to show **Open in browser** and **Open locally**.

- Package Manager: Improved the UI to show the user that they have updates to their imported assets.

- Package Manager: Reformatted the top toolbar so that you can now see all applied filters.

- Physics: Added `ArticulationBody.jointPosition` pointer lines to the Angular Joint Limits tool gizmo to show the exact position of the joint in scene view.

- Profiler: Added a Highlights module to the Profiler Window.

- Profiler: Added a new Inverted Hierarchy view for the CPU Profiler.

- Profiler: Added metadata support for AudioClip and Shader in Memory Profiler.

- Scene/Game View: Added a new Cameras Overlay to replace the former Camera preview. It's global to the SceneView and it is now possible to work in the SceneView through the lens of a camera. Select **~** in the SceneView to access the Overlays menu.

- Accessibility: Added: Added screen reader support APIs for Android and iOS, allowing Unity mobile applications to be made compatible with TalkBack \(Android\) and VoiceOver \(iOS\).

- Accessibility: Changed: Types in the `UnityEngine.Accessibility` namespace are now hosted in a separate `UnityEngine.AccessibilityModule` assembly. Managed plug-ins referencing the `UnityEngine` assembly containing type forwarders won't be affected, but if the `UnityEngine.CoreModule` was referenced directly to access these type, then this is a breaking change.

- AI: Added: New methods in the `NavMesh` class to manage the state of Link instances: `IsLinkActive()`, `SetLinkActive()`, `GetLinkOwner()`, `SetLinkOwner()`, `IsLinkValid()` and `IsLinkOccupied()`.

- AI: Added: New `OffMeshLinkData.owner` property that references either an object assigned to a Link with `NavMesh.SetLinkOwner()`, or an `OffMeshLink` component that created the link.

- AI: Deprecated: The experimental `NavMeshQuery` struct has been deprecated along with all the other types from the `UnityEngine.Experimental.AI` namespace. We've identified issues with them that require the API to be redesigned.

- AI: Deprecated: The members of the `NavMeshLinkInstance` struct have been deprecated and replaced with methods in the NavMesh class.

- AI: Deprecated: The `OffMeshLink` component and its members have been deprecated. Use \[NavMeshLink\]\(https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/NavMeshLink.html\) instead.

- AI: Deprecated: `OffMeshLinkData.offMeshLink` has been deprecated in favor of the new `OffMeshLinkData.owner` property.

- Android: Added: Added new API to Android Project Configuration Manager to be able to set data from the Editor main thread and read it in the OnModifyAndroidProjectFiles callback.

- Android: Added: Expose UnityPlayer.invokeOnMainThread, a helper function for delegating callbacks on game loop thread.

- Android: Added: Expose UnityPlayer.runningOnMainThread in java.

- Android: Added: new Android Project Configuration API that allows to copy arbitrary files to the Gradle project.

- Android: Deprecated: Deprecate OnPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject in favor of OnModifyAndroidProjectFiles.

- Android: Deprecated: The keystorePass and keyaliasPass properties in PlayerSettings class have been deprecated, use the ones from PlayerSettings.Android class.

- Android: Obsoleted: Removed ETC2 decompression fallback from Android BuildSettings and made the related scripting API obsolete. The feature had no effect since OpenGL ES 2.0 support was removed.

- Animation: Added: ClearKeys and CopyFromAPI in AnimationCurve.
    ([UUM-20456](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-volume-curves-have-impact-even-if-they-are-disabled), [UUM-20458](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-revert-property-doesnt-work-on-curves))

- Apple TV: Added: Added identifier for 3rd generation Apple TV 4K.

- Asset Pipeline: Added: AssetDatabase.GetScriptableObjectsWithMissingScriptCount and AssetDatabase.RemoveScriptableObjectsWithMissingScript for finding and removing ScriptableObject instances in assets which are missing their scripts. \(Thank you @Xelnath for the request\!\).

- Asset Pipeline: Added: AssetDatabase.TryGetAssetFolderInfo which can be used to know if a certain path is being tracked by the AssetDatabase and can handle import dependencies and asset imports.

- Build Pipeline: Added: "Dedicated Server optimizations" option that strips all shaders from Dedicated Server builds.
    (MTT-5538)

- Core: Added: APV Baking Set API.

- Core: Added: Debug.developerConsoleEnabled toggles the IMGUI-based developer console in development builds.

- Core: Added: new overloads of GameObject.CompareTag and Component.CompareTag which take a new TagHandle type. These new overloads can be more efficient, especially when comparing many objects with the same tag.

- Core: Added: overload to NativeArrayUnsafeUtility.ConvertExistingDataToNativeArray which takes a Span as input.

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` returns the maximum number of job workers that can work on a job at the same time. The job system will create a number of job worker threads that will be no greater than the number of logical CPU cores for the platform. However, since arbitrary threads can execute jobs via work stealing we allocate extra workers which act as temporary job worker threads. `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` reflects the maximum number of job worker threads<br>
    plus temporary workers the job system will ever use. As such, this value is useful for allocating buffers which should be subdivided evenly between job workers since `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` and `NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute` will never return a value greater than `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`.
    (UUM-29945)

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` returns the index for the current thread when executing a job, otherwise 0. When multiple threads are working on a parallel job at once, no two threads will have the same index. The range is \[0, `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`\). The value returned when called from within a job is the same as the one stored in a job member decorated with `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute`, otherwise 0.
    (UUM-29945)

- Documentation: Changed: Fixed duplicated inherited members in CustomRenderTexture class API documentation.

- Graphics: Added: `TextureImporterPlatformSettings.ignorePlatformSupport` to bypass platform format checks.

- Graphics: Changed: Added a new read-only `Light.dilatedRange` member. Before this addition, for area lights, if you set `Light.range`, and then immediately read it back, it would return a different value. This is because area lights have a larger effective range since the source is an area, and not a single point. Now, the `Light.range` always returns the same value you set, and the newly added `Light.dilatedRange` returns the range dilated to account for the area size.

- Graphics: Changed: Changed the value-enum FormatUsage to a flags-enum GraphicsFormatUsage.

- Graphics: Changed: Deprecated Texture2D constructors that require a boolean value and string to set up Mipmap Limit behavior in the constructor. Use MipmapLimitDescriptor to specify whether \(a\) Mipmap Limits should be enabled, and if so, \(b\) if the Texture belongs to a particular group.

- Graphics: Deprecated: Deprecated a RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance method for adding AABB ray tracing instances. An alternative method can be used that takes a structure with all the method parameters instead.

- Graphics: Deprecated: Deprecated TextureCreationFlag.IgnoreMipmapLimit. Any shape of Texture created from script will ignore Mipmap Limits by default. Use of mipmap limits can be enabled by using a MipmapLimitDescriptor in the constructor, where supported.

- Graphics: Deprecated: `Light.shape`. This information is now unified into `Light.type`.

- HDRP: Deprecated: `HDLightType`, `HDLightTypeAndShape`, `SpotLightShape`, and `AreaLightShape`. HDRP directly uses Light.type in native Unity, and handles the upgrade automatically.

- UI Toolkit: Changed Event propagation rules for ExecuteDefaultAction, ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget, and PreventDefault:<br>
    - Calling StopPropagation\(\) on an event will now also prevent ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget from being called.<br>
    - Calling PreventDefault\(\) will behave like calling both StopPropagation and focusController.IgnoreEvent, so it will also stop execution of the registered callbacks further down the propagation path.<br>
    - Both ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget are now executed in-between registered callbacks during the BubbleUp phase, immediately before any callback on the current target.<br>
    - All standard control event handling was moved to registered event callbacks or HandleEventBubbleUp overrides, and can be prevented by calling StopPropagation during the TrickleDown phase. This includes triggering the Contextual menu. The exception to this rule is behavior that's part of an event's PostDispatch method, which includes switching focus on Pointer down or navigation.<br>
    - It is strongly recommended to replace ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget overrides for a HandleEventBubbleUp override instead, and PreventDefault for StopPropagation.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the **Display** label on an interactive element.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the Event propagation rules for composite roots, making them behave more similarly to regular elements.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the Event propagation rules for Mouse compatibility events:<br>
    - Mouse compatibility events are now dispatched alongside the Pointer event associated with them, immediately following them during each step of the TrickleDown and BubbleUp propagation phases.<br>
    - Calling StopPropagation on either the pointer event or its associated compatibility mouse event will now stop the propagation of both events after the current propagation step is completed.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the number of FocusEvents and BlurEvents sent when changing a focused element if the target has at least one composite root parent.

- UI Toolkit: Removed the prevention of compatibility mouse events when cancelling PointerDownEvent.

- Universal RP: Disabled the ability for decals to enqueue passes when running on unsupported APIs, such as OpenGL or GLES3, instead of displaying the magenta error.

- Universal RP: Enabled deferred renderer to now use Framebuffer Fetch for Shadowmask.

- Universal Windows Platform: Updated the system requirements for the Universal Windows Platform Player to Windows 10 Version 21H1 \(build 19043\).

- Version Control: Changed the onboarding workflow and the icons for Unity Version Control rebranding.

- Version Control: Updated branding from **Plastic SCM** to **Unity Version Control**.<br>
    Improved offline experience by disabling the plugin when there is no internet connection.

- Windows: Added the requirement of Visual Studio 2019 and Windows 10.0.19041.0 SDK when building Windows and Universal Windows Platform with IL2CPP scripting backend.

- Windows: Updated the system requirements for the Windows Player to Windows 10 Version 21H1 \(build 19043\).

- Xbox: Moved the Package Encryption setting from Player Settings to Build Settings. Added a warning when the encryption is set to **Submission**.

- XR: Added XR Interaction Toolkit to the AR and VR Feature sets to maximize XR interactivity out of the box.

- XR: Changed the filesystem location of the serialized Vulkan pipeline cache on Quest.

- XR: Renamed the Non-Uniform Foveated Rendering shader function.

- Graphics: Introducing two new knobs so PBR DoF can now scale at 4k.<br>
    The first is a new knob "High quality Adaptive Sampling" which is enabled by default. This change allows now to turn off this feature \(which changes adaptive sampling rate\) and saves massive amount of performance.  This knob improves performance massively while keeping image quality consistent.<br>
    The second knob is high and low res PBR dof checkbox. The previous drop down has been removed, since PBR DoF has always been half res, independent of the previous enum value. This new knob now shows true representation of resolution. The new low res setting lets PBR DoF run at quarter resolution.

    * Removes history rejection when the current alpha value is 0. Instead it does blend with the history color when alpha value is 0 on the current plane.<br>
    * The reasoning for blending again with the history when alpha is 0 is because we want the color to blend a bit with opacity, which is the main reason for the alpha values. sort of like a precomputed color<br>
    * As a safety, we set the color to black if alpha is 0. This results in better image quality when alpha is enabled.

- Virtual Texturing: Virtual texturing has a severe issue: the mip chain is not available on the first frame, causing unpredictable garbage texles to be displayed on the screen. This fix helps with poping by adding a new setting to the HDRP asset. This setting lets us allocate virtual texturing mips prefetching. This setting also had to be implemented inside the VT system.<br>
    A debug panel also has live reporting of the current prefetched mips in the markers debug screen. We also add a checkbox to debug disable streaming, which helps content creators see which textures are on and off.
