This knob improves performance massively while keeping image quality consistent.<br>
    The second knob is high and low res PBR dof checkbox. The previous drop down has been removed, since PBR DoF has always been half res, independent of the previous enum value. This new knob now shows true representation of resolution. The new low res setting lets PBR DoF run at quarter resolution.

    ([UUM-21948](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-windowsvideomedia-getfirstreadytexturetime-when-focusing-gameobject-in-tutorial))

- Virtual Texturing: Virtual texturing has a severe issue: the mip chain is not available on the first frame, causing unpredictable garbage texles to be displayed on the screen. This fix helps with poping by adding a new setting to the HDRP asset. This setting lets us allocate virtual texturing mips prefetching. This setting also had to be implemented inside the VT system.<br>
    A debug panel also has live reporting of the current prefetched mips in the markers debug screen. We also add a checkbox to debug disable streaming, which helps content creators see which textures are on and off.

#### API Changes

- 2D: Added: TileAnimationFlags.UnscaledTime.

- 2D: Added: TileBaseEditor with an implementation for RenderStaticPreview, which allows users who extend from the TileBase class to have a simple default asset preview for their extended classes of TileBase.

- 2D: Added: Tilemap.loopEndedForTileAnimation callback when Animated Tiles have reached the end of their animation loop if it has the LoopOnce flag set.

- Android: Added: Expose UnityPlayer.invokeOnMainThread, a helper function for delegating callbacks on game loop thread.

- Android: Added: new Android Project Configuration API that allows to copy arbitrary files to the Gradle project.

- Android: Deprecated: Deprecate OnPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject in favor of OnModifyAndroidProjectFiles.

- Animation: Added: ClearKeys and CopyFromAPI in AnimationCurve.
    ([UUM-20456](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-volume-curves-have-impact-even-if-they-are-disabled), [UUM-20458](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-revert-property-doesnt-work-on-curves))

- Apple TV: Added: Added identifier for 3rd generation Apple TV 4K.

- Asset Pipeline: Added: AssetDatabase.GetScriptableObjectsWithMissingScriptCount and AssetDatabase.RemoveScriptableObjectsWithMissingScript for finding and removing ScriptableObject instances in assets which are missing their scripts. \(Thank you @Xelnath for the request\!\).

- Asset Pipeline: Added: AssetDatabase.TryGetAssetFolderInfo which can be used to know if a certain path is being tracked by the AssetDatabase and can handle import dependencies and asset imports.

- Build Pipeline: Added: "Dedicated Server optimizations" option that strips all shaders from Dedicated Server builds.
    (MTT-5538)

- Build Pipeline: Obsoleted: methods on BuildPipeline class will now trigger build error rather than warning and implementation is removed. These APIs have been marked obsolete since Unity 5.

- Core: Added: new overloads of GameObject.CompareTag and Component.CompareTag which take a new TagHandle type. These new overloads can be more efficient, especially when comparing many objects with the same tag.

- Core: Added: overload to NativeArrayUnsafeUtility.ConvertExistingDataToNativeArray which takes a Span as input.

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` returns the maximum number of job workers that can work on a job at the same time. The job system will create a number of job worker threads that will be no greater than the number of logical CPU cores for the platform. However, since arbitrary threads can execute jobs via work stealing we allocate extra workers which act as temporary job worker threads. `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount` reflects the maximum number of job worker threads<br>
    plus temporary workers the job system will ever use. As such, this value is useful for allocating buffers which should be subdivided evenly between job workers since `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` and `NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute` will never return a value greater than `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`.
    (UUM-29945)

- Core: Added: `JobsUtility.ThreadIndex` returns the index for the current thread when executing a job, otherwise 0. When multiple threads are working on a parallel job at once, no two threads will have the same index. The range is \[0, `JobsUtility.ThreadIndexCount`\). The value returned when called from within a job is the same as the one stored in a job member decorated with `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeSetThreadIndexAttribute`, otherwise 0.
    (UUM-29945)

- Documentation: Changed: Fixed duplicated inherited members in CustomRenderTexture class API documentation.

- Editor: Added: Exposes `EditorApplication.focusChanged` event which fires when the Editor gains and loses focus.

- Editor: Added: `EditorApplication.isFocused` property indicating the cached state of the Editors focus.

- Editor: Removed: AssetDatabase.RefreshDelayed\(\) method has been removed.

- Editor: Removed: AssetDatabase.RefreshDelayed\(ImportAssetOptions options\) method has been removed.

- Editor: Removed: Bool AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier\(int instanceID, out string guid, out int localId\) method has been removed.

- Editor: Removed: Bool AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier\(Object obj, out string guid, out int localId\) method has been removed.

- GI: Added: API for accessing global light probe data used in rendering as well as for individual scenes.

- GI: Deprecated: LightProbes.cellCount, LightProbes.count and LightProbes.positions have been deprecated.

- Graphics: Added: an `AreaLight` member to the `Rendering.ShadowMapPass` enum.

- Graphics: Added: API for modifying positions of LightProbes objects.

- Graphics: Added: AsyncGPUReadbackRequest.forcePlayerLoopUpdate.

- Graphics: Added: CanvasRenderer.GetMesh API, analogous to CanvasRenderer.SetMesh has been Added.

- Graphics: Added: Inline Ray Tracing \(Ray Query/DXR 1.1\) support to all rasterization shader stages. Added new methods for binding an acceleration structure \(Shader.SetGlobalRayTracingAccelerationStructure, CommandBuffer.SetGlobalRayTracingAccelerationStructure\). Added new pragma require inlineraytracing support in rasterization shader stages. Added new built-in global shader keyword UNITY_DEVICE_SUPPORTS_INLINE_RAY_TRACING to be used with multi_compile.

- Graphics: Changed: Added a new read-only `Light.dilatedRange` member. Before this addition, for area lights, if you set `Light.range`, and then immediately read it back, it would return a different value. This is because area lights have a larger effective range since the source is an area, and not a single point. Now, the `Light.range` always returns the same value you set, and the newly added `Light.dilatedRange` returns the range dilated to account for the area size.

- Graphics: Changed: Deprecated Texture2D constructors that require a boolean value and string to set up Mipmap Limit behavior in the constructor. Use MipmapLimitDescriptor to specify whether \(a\) Mipmap Limits should be enabled, and if so, \(b\) if the Texture belongs to a particular group.

- Graphics: Changed: Deprecated `Area` in favor of `Rectangle` in the `LightType` enum. Added `Box`, `Pyramid`, and `Tube` members to the same enum.

- Graphics: Deprecated: Deprecated TextureCreationFlag.IgnoreMipmapLimit. Any shape of Texture created from script will ignore Mipmap Limits by default. Use of mipmap limits can be enabled by using a MipmapLimitDescriptor in the constructor, where supported.

- Graphics: Deprecated: `Light.shape`. This information is now unified into `Light.type`.

- HDRP: Deprecated: `HDLightType`, `HDLightTypeAndShape`, `SpotLightShape`, and `AreaLightShape`. HDRP directly uses Light.type in native Unity, and handles the upgrade automatically.

- Input: Added: Expose Input.mousePositionDelta.

- iOS: Added: identifiers for iPad models released in 2022.

- Networking: Removed: The legacy networking API \(Network, NetworkView, etc\), which was marked as obsolete in 2018, has now has been deleted.

- SRP Core: Added: Common C\# &amp; Shader Code for Scalable Temporal Post-Processing Upscaler.

- SRP Core: Added: new VolumeManager API to manage default volume profiles.

- SRP Core: Added: ObjectID Render Request that provides a render texture with the ObjectId of each pixel.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added API to know when a panel may need to be rendered to use in conjunction with on demand rendering.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added canChangeExpandedState to tree view controllers to allow users to disable items expansion.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added drag and drop API for collection views; canStartDrag, setupDragAndDrop, dragAndDropUpdate and handleDrop, similar to what exists in IMGUI.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added GetIndentationDepth and GetIndentationDepthByIndex in tree view controllers.

- UI Toolkit: Added: callback for receiving all changes inside a panel.

- UI Toolkit: Added: VisualElement methods HandleEventBubbleUp and HandleEventTrickleDown.<br>
    Added FocusController method IgnoreEvent.

- UI Toolkit: Obsoleted: EventBase method PreventDefault. Not upgradable automatically.

- UI Toolkit: Obsoleted: PropagationPhase values AtTarget, DefaultAction, and DefaultActionAtTarget. Not upgradabe automatically.

- UI Toolkit: Obsoleted: VisualElement methods ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget. Not upgradable automatically.

- Universal RP: Removed: Removed RenderTargetHandle and Scriptable Renderer backwards compatibility with RenderTargetHandle and RenderTargetIdentifiers. RTHandles to be used.

- Version Control: Removed: Removed Collab and its dependency from the package.

- XR: Obsoleted: The old Subsystem APIs are marked as obsolete in favor of the SubsystemWithProvider APIs.

    (UUM-20831)

- Editor: Moved the Mesh Preview and list of meshes to a separate foldout for the Frame Debugger.

- Editor: Removed the automatic upgrade code for UniversalRendererData from alpha and beta builds of 2021.2 to the current version as it is no longer required and was incurring a domain reload performance cost.

- Editor: Updated the system requirements for the Windows Editor to Windows 10 Version 21H1 \(build 19043\).

- GI: Moved the **Recalculate Environment Lighting** setting to **Project Settings** &gt; **Editor**. This setting was previously in the **Lighting Window** &gt; **Workflow**.

- GI: Moved the toggle for displaying lightmap resolution in scene view modes to a panel that is displayed when the relevant modes are active.

- GI: Removed the **Show lightmap resolution overlay** from the Project settings window. Use the toggle in the scene view instead.

- Tests: Replaced tests in `CodebaseTests.cs` with a Yamato job that can run on each PR.

- UI Toolkit: Changed Event propagation rules for ExecuteDefaultAction, ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget, and PreventDefault:<br>
    - Calling StopPropagation\(\) on an event will now also prevent ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget from being called.<br>
    - Calling PreventDefault\(\) will behave like calling both StopPropagation and focusController.IgnoreEvent, so it will also stop execution of the registered callbacks further down the propagation path.<br>
    - Both ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget are now executed in-between registered callbacks during the BubbleUp phase, immediately before any callback on the current target.<br>
    - All standard control event handling was moved to registered event callbacks or HandleEventBubbleUp overrides, and can be prevented by calling StopPropagation during the TrickleDown phase. This includes triggering the Contextual menu. The exception to this rule is behavior that's part of an event's PostDispatch method, which includes switching focus on Pointer down or navigation.<br>
    - It is strongly recommended to replace ExecuteDefaultAction and ExecuteDefaultActionAtTarget overrides for a HandleEventBubbleUp override instead, and PreventDefault for StopPropagation.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the Event propagation rules for composite roots, making them behave more similarly to regular elements.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the Event propagation rules for Mouse compatibility events:<br>
    - Mouse compatibility events are now dispatched alongside the Pointer event associated with them, immediately following them during each step of the TrickleDown and BubbleUp propagation phases.<br>
    - Calling StopPropagation on either the pointer event or its associated compatibility mouse event will now stop the propagation of both events after the current propagation step is completed.

- UI Toolkit: Changed the number of FocusEvents and BlurEvents sent when changing a focused element if the target has at least one composite root parent.

- UI Toolkit: Removed the prevention of compatibility mouse events when cancelling PointerDownEvent.

- Universal RP: Disabled the ability for decals to enqueue passes when running on unsupported APIs, such as OpenGL or GLES3, instead of displaying the magenta error.

    Improved offline experience by disabling the plugin when there is no internet connection.

- Windows: Updated the system requirements for the Windows Player to Windows 10 Version 21H1 \(build 19043\).

- Xbox: Moved the Package Encryption setting from Player Settings to Build Settings. Added a warning when the encryption is set to **Submission**.

- XR: Changed the filesystem location of the serialized Vulkan pipeline cache on Quest.
