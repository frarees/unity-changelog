    ([UUM-58573](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-enum-properties-get-set-to-0-instead-of-the-value-specified-in-the-scene-when-the-property-is-animated-by-a-state-that-is-not-playing))

    ([UUM-52194](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/performance-degrades-and-fps-decreases-when-adding-a-lot-of-inactive-audiosources-to-a-scene-with-audibility-computation-taking-11ms))

- Build System: Don't crash on windows if there are duplicate environment variable keys.

- Burst: Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions `cvt_ss2si`, `cvtss_si32`, and `cvtss_si64` to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.

- Burst: If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted.  In order to fix this \( editor only - player builds are unaffected\), we now save some additional context on each entry point.

- Editor: Context menus in transient search now respect light mode themes on macOS.

    ([UUM-26081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-context-menu-in-hierarchy-is-available-but-not-functional-when-the-editor-is-out-of-focus))

- Editor: Printing proper message into console when compiling mesh data optimization processing to avoid confusing logs.
    ([UUM-54590](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/variant-count-after-stripping-is-increased-for-the-first-build-after-shader-keyword-changes))

- Editor: Some visionOS builds will no longer fail with an inability to execute process_symbols.sh.

- GI: Fixed crash on Apple Silicon in llvm::VectorType::get when opening a specific project.
    ([UUM-59133](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/silicon-crash-on-llvm-vectortype-get-when-opening-a-specific-project))

- Graphics: Clarify RenderTexture creation error wording to use "volumeDepth" instead of "depth".
    (UUM-59895)

- Graphics: DrawProceduralNow family of functions also provide emulated vertexbuffers.

    ([UUM-52930](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graphics-dot-renderprimitives-does-not-work-when-using-surface-shaders))

- Graphics: When using CaptureScreenshotAsTexture during the rendering process with Metal API, if the results are undefined then Unity now outputs an error instead of crashing.
    (UUM-47096)

- HDRP: Async compute Presents issues when depending on the first texture read of depth. In some platforms \(vulkan/dx12 and some consoles\) the first read of depth is actually a write because of decompression / layout / barriers.<br>
    Async compute is inserting the fence before this operation because RenderGraph sees everything as a simple Read / Write.<br>
    Temporarily hacking this so the first read of depth is tagged as a write, so the correct fence is inserted.
    (UUM-57601)

- HDRP: Fixed incorrect shadows rendering in player.
    ([UUM-7816](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-wrong-material-variant-picked-in-player))

- IL2CPP: Fixed conversion errors on constrained calls in shared generic code.
    (UUM-55756)

- IL2CPP: Fixed crash when calling Type.IsGenericTypeParameter and Type.IsGenericMethodParameter.
    ([UUM-56064](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-type-get-isgenerictypeparameter-m64b33ca8a518c68b58352ce3d66c2b0774292c4c-when-calling-isgenerictypeparameter-on-unbound-generic-types-in-il2cpp-player))

    ([UUM-57901](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-player-crash-on-memset-in-vcruntime140d-when-selecting-ui-gameobject))

- Linux: Fixed CursorLockMode.Confined does not confine cursor when using multiple displays.
    ([UUM-57233](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-cursorlockmode-dot-confined-does-not-confine-cursor-when-using-multiple-displays))

- macOS: Fixed secondary display refresh rate values being invalid.
    ([UUM-37294](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/frames-in-the-player-are-not-skipped-if-the-player-is-moved-to-a-different-monitor-when-using-ondemandrendering-and-vsynccount))

    ([UUM-25408](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadows-alpha-clipping-is-ignored-and-shadows-rendered-without-details-in-player))

- Profiler: Fixed an issue whereby all Rendering statistics could be zero in Play Mode when the application's target frame rate was set.
    ([UUM-58128](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-rendering-profiler-module-statistics-are-zero-when-application-dot-targetframerate-is-set))

- Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where continuously panning an orthographic SceneView camera would eventually cause the rendered geometry to be clipped.
    ([UUM-56425](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/panning-to-sides-causes-the-camera-clipping-a-gameobject-in-scene-view-when-the-scene-is-viewed-from-the-top-and-is-in-orthographic-projection-mode))

    ([UUM-59203](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dynamic-branching-shader-code-cant-be-shared-with-passes-that-dont-declare-the-keywords))

- Shaders: Ensures internal shader compiler errors such as losing connection to a compiler process aren't cached like compilation errors are.
    (UUM-28802)

- Shaders: Fixed an incorrect warning being shown when doing paired calls to SetAsyncCompilation / RestoreAsyncCompilation on RenderingCommandBuffer.
    ([UUM-59508](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/calling-setasynccompilation-without-matching-restoreasynccompilation-is-thrown-when-using-shaderutil-dot-setasynccompilation-and-shaderutil-dot-restoreasynccompilation))
