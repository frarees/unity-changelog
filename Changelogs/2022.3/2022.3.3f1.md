    * Removes history rejection when the current alpha value is 0. Instead it does blend with the history color when alpha value is 0 on the current plane.<br>
    * The reasoning for blending again with the history when alpha is 0 is because we want the color to blend a bit with opacity, which is the main reason for the alpha values. sort of like a precomputed color<br>
    * As a safety, we set the color to black if alpha is 0. This results in better image quality when alpha is enabled.
