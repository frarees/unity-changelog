### 2022.3.24f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Documentation: Documentation fixes for the Animation and Math API.
    (UUM-67920)

- VFX Graph: Improved compilation times with VFX Graph using Subgraphs.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed hint text not showing when trying to slice compress texture in Sprite Editor Window slice menu.
    ([UUM-59303](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprites-are-sliced-wrong-when-they-are-being-sliced-automatically-on-iossupport-platform-for-macos))

- 2D: Fixed usage of a Tile Palette with the XZ orientation in the Tile Palette window.
    (UUM-67593)

- Animation: Fixed crash when deleting states in some state machines. If a state machine contained a state machine transition with a null source state \(which should not happen under normal circumstances\), unity would crash when deleting any state within the same state machine. It does not crash anymore.
    ([UUM-66549](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-animatorstatemachine-removetransitionswithdeletingobject-when-deleting-a-newly-created-empty-state-in-animator-controller))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where the TextureImporter didn't correctly apply "Read/Write" for Texture2DArrays and Texture3Ds. To avoid changing behavior, old TextureImporter 2DArray / 3D assets will automatically be treated as "Read/Write" enabled: make sure to change the importer setting if this is undesired.
    ([UUM-61560](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-read-slash-write-flag-on-texture2darray-isnt-taking-effect))

- Editor: Fixed driver version in documentation of optix.
    ([UUM-66825](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/optix-minimum-driver-version-number-is-incorrect))

- Editor: Inspector window controls should no longer become unresponsive after exiting playmode.
    ([UUM-64580](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-interact-with-material-inspector-window-when-entering-and-exiting-play-mode))

- GI: Fixed slowdown in lighting settings UI.
    ([UUM-62034](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-freezes-when-selecting-a-gameobject-in-the-scene-view-during-the-play-mode))

- Graphics: Fixed ReadPixels\(\) using different Y positions.
    ([UUM-58287](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/readpixels-uses-different-y-positions-when-built-with-vulkan))

- HDRP: Fixed screen node not returning correct resolution after post-processing when dynamic resolution is enabled.
    (UUM-67225)

- HDRP: Fixed specular blend in premultiplied alpha.
    (UUM-48661)

- Scripting: Corrected crashes due to excessive use of thread local data slots.
    ([UUM-58965](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-crash-on-slash-data-slash-app-slash-com-dot-defaultcompany-dot-webviewandroid-7upuhqo4grf2kpmrmcjrdg-equals-equals-slash-lib-slash-arm64-slash-libxul-dot-so-libxul-dot-so-offset-0x518000-on-android-devices-when-using-webview))

    ([UUM-54597](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/text-in-certain-parts-of-the-unity-editor-appears-pink-with-white-dots-when-using-macos))

    ([UUM-66550](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/managedreference-fields-with-a-custom-propertydrawer-arent-refreshed-properly-when-changing-properties))

- UI Toolkit: Nested PropertyDrawer didn't work when there's both an Attribute drawer and a Drawer for the type.
    ([UUM-66687](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nested-propertydrawer-doesnt-work-when-theres-both-an-attribute-drawer-and-a-drawer-for-the-type))

- UI Toolkit: When in Runtime on mobile, a ScrollView will no longer scroll if the touch interaction needs to be treated by a child element first \(ex: a menu from a DropdownField\).
    ([UUM-39969](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scrollview-scrolls-when-clicking-a-button-after-selecting-the-dropdownfield-item))

- Universal RP: Fixed depth buffer disappearing after using SwapColorBuffer.
    ([UUM-44446](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/depthtarget-disappears-when-calling-swapcolorbuffer))

    ([UUM-21302](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vfx-file-gets-modified-without-making-changes-when-saving-project))

- WebGL: Fixed an issue that prevented multithreaded builds from working if user repeatedly upgraded and then downgraded their project.
    ([UUM-33218](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-index-dot-html-file-is-generated-incorrectly-when-building-a-webgl-project))
