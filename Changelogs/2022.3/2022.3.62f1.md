- Web: Work around a browser bug, where, on some platforms, Time.realtimeSinceStartup/Time.realtimeSinceStartupAsDouble did not include elapsed time in system sleep when accessing these properties. Note that this may limit the precision of these properties to millisecond-level. For precise frame timing use Time.time instead.

    (UUM-99397)

- Windows: On Windows, fixed a few related bugs where if the Unity project/player settings were set to the Quad speaker mode, we would still output sound to the front center channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. Similarly, if Unity is set to use the surround \(5.0\) speaker mode, we would still output sound to the LFE channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. This has now been fixed.
