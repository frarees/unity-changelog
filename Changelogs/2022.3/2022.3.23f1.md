### 2022.3.23f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- iOS: Added .xcframework plugins support.

- Package: Added Apple privacy manifest in moderation package.



#### Improvements

- Burst: Added clearer diagnostic error for certain bad usages of IsSupportedXXX intrinsics.

- Burst: Added support for Burst with the visionOS Simulator SDK.

- Burst: Added support for Windows Arm64.
