### 2022.3.35f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- HDRP: Transparent materials now appear opaque when using Mipmap Streaming debug views for increased clarity.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed a Sprite Mask issue with target sorting layers.
    ([UUM-72180](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-masks-affect-sprite-renderers-outside-their-range-when-a-light2d-is-present-with-specific-target-sorting-layers-selected))

- Android: Fixed an issue where setting the graphics jobs mode to Legacy through the API PlayerSettings.graphicsJobMode was broken on Android. It now works as expected on Android devices.
    (UUM-74079)

- Burst: Fixed compiler crash caused by faulty alias analysis.

- Documentation: Added Cloth and Trail Renderer colors to the Preferences page.

- Documentation: Updated directions to the Project Settings window in our Settings page.

- Editor: Fixed an issue where Cloud Diagnostics build-time functionality was not disabled if the Cloud Diagnostics package was removed from a project without first disabling it in the package settings. Now the package ensures that Cloud Diagnostics is fully disabled upon removal from a project.

- Editor: Fixed an issue where polygons are created on the opposite side of the sprite for uGUI images.
    ([UUM-71372](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/polygons-are-created-on-the-opposite-side-of-the-sprite-when-the-sprite-boundaries-are-above-the-edge-of-the-texture))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where saving a new scene with cloned dependencies overwrote existing folder.
    ([UUM-66799](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/existing-folder-contents-are-overwritten-with-the-globalvolumeprofile-asset-when-saving-a-new-standard-urp-scene-in-unity))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where users could not skip local package scanning during version control initialization by including a  new setting.
    ([UUM-70391](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-editor-hangs-when-opening-a-project-that-uses-local-packages-and-version-control))

- Editor: Fixed ordering of CustomEditor so even if removing CustomEditor the order stays deterministic.
    ([UUM-67599](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/custom-buttons-of-a-script-in-the-inspector-disappear-when-an-unrelated-script-is-deleted))

- Graphics: Fixed an issue where calling "Texture.SetStreamingTextureMaterialDebugProperties" did not properly set debug properties on materials if Texture Streaming had never been enabled in the current session.

- Graphics: Fixed dynamic batching not using NEON optimized path when vertex normals or tangents are used.
    (UUM-72138)

- HDRP: Fixed a motion blur blending issue.
    ([UUM-54446](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/motion-blur-halo-artifacts-when-using-hdrp))

    ([UUM-48894](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-nullreferenceexxception-when-exiting-play-mode-with-hdrp-plus-dlss-plus-xr))

- HDRP: Fixed an issue where certain Mipmap Streaming debug views \(for example: "Mip Count"\) would not show up correctly on Metal.

- HDRP: Fixed an issue where the Mipmap Streaming debug views would show up incorrectly when certain features were enabled \(SRP Batcher, Volumetric Fog, Volumetric Clouds, and,...\).
    ([UUM-70478](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-mip-map-debugging-view-turns-white-if-there-are-directional-lights-in-the-scene))

- HDRP: Fixed an issue where the Rendering Debugger "Terrain Texture" drop-down would appear only when enabling a Fullscreen Debug Mode, instead of appearing when enabling a Mipmap Streaming debug view as intended.

- iOS: Fixed a small memory leak in UnityWebRequest \(custom HTTP headers\).
    ([UUM-73104](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-memory-leaks-occur-when-unitywebrequest-dot-get-is-called))
