    ([UUM-70287](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-warnings-are-being-thrown-after-building-high-definition-3d-project))

- Package Manager: Install icon is shown for custom packages.
    (UUM-73538)

- Profiler: Fixed "Page range is outside of system region range. Please report a bug\!" error for captured memory snapshots and opened in the Memory Profiler packaged, caused by Unity Objects getting created in-between of capturing the Managed Heap and Native Object data. Snapshots before this fix are not fixed by this change but future captures won't have the same issue. This also fixes cases where Unity Objects in a Memory Snapshot might have pointed at invalid data for their Managed Shell, which may have been most notable with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject types. This may also have fixed a vanishingly small amount of instances of reported "Leaked Managed Shell" objects where the Native Object part of the object got destroyed just after the managed Heap data was captured. The close timing makes the likelihood of all of these issues very rare and more likely the longer it takes to capture a snapshot.
    (UUM-77449)

- Profiler: Fixed a Memory Profiler issue that could cause the total size of a memory root to differ slightly from the sum of its individually reported allocations, as allocation header bytes and unused/fragmentation bytes could be included.
    (UUM-75352)

- Scene/Game View: "Application.isFocused" returns "false" when entering the Play Mode with the Game window set to "Play Unfocused".
    ([UUM-74498](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/application-dot-isfocused-initially-returns-true-when-entering-the-play-mode-with-the-game-window-set-to-play-unfocused))

- Scripting: Fixed Application.exitCancellationToken is called at wrong time when it is registered before the Start.
    ([UUM-73462](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/application-dot-exitcancellationtoken-is-called-at-the-wrong-time-when-they-are-registered-before-the-start-method))

- Serialization: Don't show crash reporter when reading corrupted files.
    ([UUM-66157](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-cachedreader-outofboundserror-when-pressing-the-quit-button-in-the-fatal-error-modal-window))

- Shadergraph: Added a null reference exception when shader variant project settings were changed under certain circumstances.
    ([UUM-75697](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-and-value-does-not-change-when-changing-the-shader-variant-limit-value-after-exiting-the-play-mode))

    ([UUM-76472](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-preview-variant-limit-can-be-set-to-a-negative-value))

- Shaders: Fixed compiling shaders using GLSL/MSL reserved words for buffer or texture names.
    (UUM-60049)

    ([UUM-71130](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/field-names-under-anchors-in-the-recttransform-component-dont-get-focused-when-tabbing-through-the-fields))

- Universal RP: Fixed an issue where glClientWaitSync: Expected application to have kicked everything until job: 96089 \(possibly by calling glFlush\)" are thrown in the Android Player on some devices with PowerVR Rogue GE8320 GPU.

- Windows: Fixed keyboard keys display name provided by Input System displaying wrong Unicode character in certain situation when using some international layout.
    ([UUM-71799](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/keycontrol-dot-displayname-has-an-incorrect-value-for-the-a-key-when-the-keyboard-language-is-set-to-german-while-in-play-mode))
