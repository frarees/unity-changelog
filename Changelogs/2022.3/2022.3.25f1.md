    (UUM-31719)

- Android: Compass timestamp as time elapsed in seconds since the device was last turned on.
    ([UUM-64955](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-the-values-returned-by-input-dot-compass-dot-timestamp-on-android-do-not-correspond-to-the-timestamp-format-in-seconds-since-1970-as-indicated-in-unitys-documentation))

- Android: Fixed issue where Unity during application quit would unchain from different signals via sigaction, than the one chained at the application start.
