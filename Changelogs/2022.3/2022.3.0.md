### New 2022.3.0f1 Entries since 2022.2.21f1

#### Fixes

-   Android: Avoid an error generated by the Vulkan loader on Android when trying to load vkGetPhysicalDeviceFragmentShadingRatesKHR as Vulkan device function

-   Android: Filter some redundant warnings on some Adreno devices that cause severe performance issues in development builds

-   Build Pipeline: Fixed crash during Content File loading due to out of bounds array access.

-   Core: Allows` NativeArray&lt;T&gt;.Dispose(JobHandle) `to be callabled from a Burst compiled function. Previously an InvalidOperationException would be thrown saying \"Reflection data was not set up by an Initialize() call.\"

-   Core: Fixed GameObject being set to dirty after setting active to false when parent is inactive and activeSelf was already false.

-   Editor: Fix crash caused by gpu out of mem([UUM-25089](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-crash-with-multiple-stack-traces-when-opening-a-project-created-from-test-track-template))

-   Editor: Fixed margins appearing in game view on Windows displays with non-integer display scale([UUM-32991](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/game-view-has-huge-borders-around-when-free-aspect-is-selected-on-windows-machine))

-   GI: Fixed a bug where moving the camera while in an scene visualization mode would cause light bakes to never finish.(UUM-34425)

-   Graphics: Disable Vulkan DebugUtilsLabels for Linux AMD due to driver crash bug(UUM-31640)
