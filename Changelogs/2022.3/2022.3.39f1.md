### 2022.3.39f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Editor: Added details to the "incompatible keyword space" error message which is occasionally generated by shaders.
    ([UUM-58563](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/state-comes-from-incompatible-keyword-space-error-not-very-informative))



#### Fixes

- AI: Fixed an issue where NavMeshData belonging to a scene would remain loaded after the scene had been offloaded. This issue only occurred when the "Do not reload scene"-option has been checked in the editor settings.
    ([UUM-29346](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/navmesh-from-previous-scene-is-visible-after-going-into-play-mode-when-reload-scene-is-toggled-off))

- Animation: Fixed additive animations ever increasing non animated values.
    ([UUM-68376](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobject-continues-to-increase-in-scale-when-the-animation-layers-blending-is-set-to-additive))

- DX12: Corrected unbind counter resources to prevent GPU crash.
    ([UUM-75100](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dx12-player-crash-on-unitymain-when-building-hdrp-sample-on-windows))

- DX12: Fixed incorrect values for GetNextFrameFenceValue\(\) in render plugins.
    (UUM-72389)

- Editor: Fixed wrong unity version in gradle overview documentation.
    (UUM-75674)

    ([UUM-67677](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-camera-releasecamerastackrenderingstate-when-searching-in-hierarchy))

- Graphics: The condition for the "Graphics.CopyTexture with a region will not copy readable texture data for compressed formats" warnings has been fixed to match the documentation so that when a CPU copy would not normally be attempted \(ie., at least one texture is not readable\), the warnings will not appear.
    ([UUM-73721](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graphics-dot-copytexture-with-a-region-will-not-copy-readable-texture-data-for-compressed-formats-warnings-are-thrown-when-copying-compressed-texture-regions))

    ([UUM-55832](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-when-calling-camera-dot-render-during-onapplicationquit-while-cast-shadows-is-checked-in-the-particle-system-component))

- Shadergraph: Fixed issues with the Feature Examples sample and Production Ready Shaders sample.

    ([UUM-62347](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-increases-gradually-when-the-camera-is-opened-and-closed))

- Windows: Fixed issue with non-native Refreshrate not being restored in Exclusive Fullscreen mode upon restart.
    ([UUM-62542](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-refresh-rate-is-not-restored-after-restarting-when-setting-the-refresh-rate-to-a-non-native-one-in-exclusivefullscreen-mode))
