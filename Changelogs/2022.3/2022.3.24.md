### 2022.3.24f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   Documentation: Documentation fixes for the Animation and Math API.(UUM-67920)

-   VFX Graph: Improved compilation times with VFX Graph using Subgraphs.

#### Fixes

-   2D: Fixed hint text not showing when trying to slice compress texture in Sprite Editor Window slice menu.([UUM-59303](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprites-are-sliced-wrong-when-they-are-being-sliced-automatically-on-iossupport-platform-for-macos))

-   2D: Fixed usage of a Tile Palette with the XZ orientation in the Tile Palette window.(UUM-67593)

-   Animation: Fixed crash when deleting states in some state machines. If a state machine contained a state machine transition with a null source state (which should not happen under normal circumstances), unity would crash when deleting any state within the same state machine. It does not crash anymore.([UUM-66549](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-animatorstatemachine-removetransitionswithdeletingobject-when-deleting-a-newly-created-empty-state-in-animator-controller))

-   Editor: Fixed an issue where the TextureImporter didn\'t correctly apply \"Read/Write\" for Texture2DArrays and Texture3Ds. To avoid changing behavior, old TextureImporter 2DArray / 3D assets will automatically be treated as \"Read/Write\" enabled: make sure to change the importer setting if this is undesired.([UUM-61560](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-read-slash-write-flag-on-texture2darray-isnt-taking-effect))

-   Graphics: Fixed ReadPixels() using different Y positions.([UUM-58287](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/readpixels-uses-different-y-positions-when-built-with-vulkan))

-   HDRP: Fixed screen node not returning correct resolution after post-processing when dynamic resolution is enabled.(UUM-67225)

-   HDRP: Fixed specular blend in premultiplied alpha.(UUM-48661)

-   Scripting: Corrected crashes due to excessive use of thread local data slots.([UUM-58965](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-crash-on-slash-data-slash-app-slash-com-dot-defaultcompany-dot-webviewandroid-7upuhqo4grf2kpmrmcjrdg-equals-equals-slash-lib-slash-arm64-slash-libxul-dot-so-libxul-dot-so-offset-0x518000-on-android-devices-when-using-webview))

-   UI Toolkit: When in Runtime on mobile, a ScrollView will no longer scroll if the touch interaction needs to be treated by a child element first (ex: a menu from a DropdownField).([UUM-39969](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scrollview-scrolls-when-clicking-a-button-after-selecting-the-dropdownfield-item))
