### 2022.3.33f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Shadergraph: Added a new set of sample content - Production Ready Shaders - to the Shader Graph package.



#### API Changes

- Editor: Added: Added helper functions to PackageInfo, to query the existence of packages, to optimize use cases that previously used GetAllRegisteredPackages.

- Editor: Deprecated: Using XRSettings.enabled to enable/disable XR for an application is now deprecated in favor of calling Start\(\)/Stop\(\) on an XRDisplaySubystem instance.<br>
    Using XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName to load XR devices is now deprecated in favor of querying subsystem descriptors to create and start the subsystems of your choice with the SubystemManager.
    (UUM-30572)



#### Changes

- Package: Updated localization package to 1.5.2.



#### Fixes

- Android: Fixed IMGUI input even position when screen is scaled to different resolution than the view it's in when input backend was set to New Input.
    (UUM-68787)

- Android: In multi-window mode, when "Run in background" is true and "Mute Other Audio Sources" is false, Unity will run and sound will always play. When "Run in background" is true and "Mute Other Audio Sources" is true, Unity will always run, but you will only hear the Unity app's sound if its window has focus. Sound will be muted when the Unity window is not in focus. In multi-window mode, if "Run in background" is false, Unity will not run and sound will stop playing.
