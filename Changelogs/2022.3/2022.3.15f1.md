### 2022.3.15f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Burst: Burst support for Apple visionOS.

- Universal RP: Improved renderViewportScale for XR intermediate textures.



#### Changes

- Editor: Added visionOS icons for build target selection and player settings.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed AnimatedTile not animating in a player build.
    (UUM-55931)

- 2D: Fixed case where URP freeform lights glitch when Light points are close to one another.
    ([UUM-43318](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-freeform-lights-glitch-when-light-points-are-close-to-one-another))

- AI: Built-in navigation components are no longer hidden from the Add Component menu if the AI Navigation package is not installed. Instead, affected workflows provide shortcuts to install the package.

- AI: Editor: Fixed crashes and instabilities arising from hiding built-in Navigation components in menus.
    (UUM-53002)

- Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.4.0.

- Android: Input device listener processes the callback on UI thread, instead of the Main thread; this was incompatible with GameActivity setup, where Java looper is not present on Unity's main thread. This change fixed the bug where DualShock4 controller was not recognised after being disconnected and reconnected to certain Android devices.
    ([UUM-52211](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-duolashock4-controller-is-not-detected-after-disconnecting-and-reconnecting-controller-while-the-player-is-running-in-the-background))

- Android: When picking target API level which is not the highest installed API level, Unity will now show a dialog asking if you want install it and will install missing API level upon request, previously Unity would throw an error and would ask you to install API level manually. This new behavior will be available only in non batch mode, in batch mode you would still receive an error, the reason is to avoid potential implicit errors.
    (UUM-52052)

- Animation: Fixed crash with multithreaded evaluation after calling ApplyOverrides on AnimatorOverrideController.
    ([UUM-31848](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-on-mono-jit-runtime-invoke-when-entering-the-play-mode))

    ([UUM-46142](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-s-editorsettings-equals-null-when-exiting-the-editor-with-accelerator-active))

- Audio: Fixed a bug that prevented the Script Inspector from showing a VU meter when the script overrides `OnAudioFilterRead`.
    (UUM-51045)

- Audio: Updated wrong tooltip when hovering over the "Load In Background" property of an audio clip.
    ([UUM-27581](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/wrong-tooltip-when-hovering-over-the-load-in-background-property-of-an-audio-clip))

- Editor: Added placeholder label in inspector for uninitialized managed reference. This provides parity with IMGUI behavior.
    (UUM-54080)

    ([UUM-55851](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/search-indexing-restart-each-time-you-start-unity))
