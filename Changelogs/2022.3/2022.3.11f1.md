### 2022.3.11f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Particles: Added BakeTexture and BakeTrailsTexture scripting methods.

- Particles: Added the Custom Vertex Streams feature for particle trails.

- XR: Unity's integrated support for tone-mapping and outputting to HDR Displays in URP, HDRP and the built-in render pipeline has been extended to allow support for XR devices that have a HDR display.



#### Improvements

- Editor: Improved performance when fetching artifacts that are missing \(e.g link to an artifact deleted from the project\).
    ([UUM-22002](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-animator-window-is-slow-when-displaying-a-blend-tree-with-many-nodes))
