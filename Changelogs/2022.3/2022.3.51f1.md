- Editor: Windows moved to a different display on Windows upon display disconnect will no longer have the minimum size.

- Graphics: Fixed issue in which raw Image that uses a Material with a custom Shader is invisible in Canvas when "Screen Space - Overlay" is set and the Player is in "Windowed" mode.
    ([UUM-73042](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/raw-image-that-uses-a-material-with-a-custom-shader-is-invisible-in-canvas-when-screen-space-overlay-is-set-and-the-player-is-in-windowed-mode))

- Graphics: When using the Metal graphics API, SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat\(\) will now check the Metal device's readWriteTextureSupport tier to check whether a texture format supports simultaneous read and writes in a shader. With this change, this function will now return false for some texture formats that previously made it return true. One example is RenderTextureFormat.RG16 that previously made it return true but now false is returned instead.
    ([UUM-70740](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/supportsrandomwriteonrendertextureformat-shows-false-when-executed-on-2023-dot-2-and-6000-dot-0-streams))

    ([UUM-76306](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-leak-when-using-net-sockets))

- Particles: Scheduling a Particle System job outside of MonoBehaviour.OnParticleUpdateJobScheduled\(\) will now generate an InvalidOperationException in order to prevent incorrect job schedules which could cause a hang.
    ([UUM-79599](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-freezes-slash-hangs-when-calling-schedulebatch-for-ijobparticlesystemparallelforbatch))

- Physics: Fixed an issue with the Cloth component's inspector where exiting play-mode with the self and inter collision tool open would cause a null reference exception.
    ([UUM-78853](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-nullreferenceexception-object-reference-not-set-to-an-instance-of-an-object-and-cannot-modify-overlay-dot-displayed-during-event-of-type-eventtype-dot-layout-shown-when-entering-the-play-mode-with-self-collision-and-inter-collision-window-focused))

- Physics: Revert fix for small body tunnelling at high \(~200Hz\) simulation frequencies. If effected please use recommended workaround \(decrease ccd threshold to slightly under 1/4 of the half-extent of the scene's smallest object\).

- Shadergraph: Added issue where precision mismatch could result in an asset failing to import.
    ([UUM-74920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/invalidoperationexception-precision-mismatch-error-is-thrown-in-the-console-when-multiplying-two-half-precision-values-in-a-multiply-node-with-single-precision-in-shader-graph))

    ([UUM-49399](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-is-reverted-to-its-primary-state-when-entering-play-mode-without-saving-changes))

- Shaders: Fixed a copy/paste issue when right-clicking on the property of shader created with TexturePropertySingleLine\(\).
    (UUM-78130)

- Shaders: Fixed compute shader compilation variant cache hits to be reported correctly in the editor log.
    ([UUM-75264](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-cache-is-not-used-when-building-the-player-repeatedly))
