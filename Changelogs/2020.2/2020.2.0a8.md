*   Asset Import: Adding multiple MonoBehaviour scripts on the same GameObject using OnPostprocessModel during a ModelImporter import does not log uniqueness warning on new assets. It still does log the message on already imported assets because all references to it would be lost otherwise. (1176912)
    
*   Asset Import: AssetDatabaseExperimental.GetAvailableImporterTypes returns all expected registered importers for a given asset path. ([1218830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scriptedimporter-does-not-register-autoselect-properly))

*   Asset Pipeline: ArtifactID is now unique for an import result (1193231)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Asset Import results can now have dependencies to script types. If an asset has a dependency to a script type, the asset will now get re-imported if script type serialization format changes. ([1215729](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-scripts-inspector-values-are-not-updated-after-script-is-changed-and-recompiled))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Changed behavior in Refresh  
    
    *   Empty folders that don't have .meta files get deleted if the folders were known before.  
        
    *   If an orphaned .meta file is marked as folderAsset the folder is recreated.  
        These changes address issues related to creating/deleting folders in certain (p4, git) version controlled projects where empty folders don't get created/deleted when the user gets latest version on the client.
*   Asset Pipeline: Changing the platform is not propagated to the asset import worker process
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed crashes happening when calling (ADBv2) SetImporterOverride directly from OnAssetsModified for a new asset that hasn't been imported previously (i.e. dragged into the project browser). ([1231143](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/calling-assetdatabaseexperimental-dot-setimporteroverride-on-a-new-asset-that-hasnt-been-imported-previously-causes-a-crash))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed issue where postprocessors with version 0 wouldn't be used
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed issue with asserts triggered, when importer is creating asset on existing asset. Bad legacy importer behaviour, but it is currently supported. (1225324)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Having information that says "version 2" is selected, can be confusing, since users could assume that the "version 1" of the asset import pipeline could be selected. This has been removed completely as 2020.1 can on the Asset Import Pipeline that was re-written for 2019.3
    
*   Asset Pipeline: If the license is not valid asset import worker processes will fail and block the main editor (1224855)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Optimized Project Browser in Two Column mode when a change happens to the AssetDatabase (added/removed/updated assets). ([1228345](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/optimize-project-browser-when-new-files-added))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Source Asset reloading improved, so that loaded objects get reloaded, if the associated script is modified ([1141360](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/serialized-property-values-are-not-restored-until-the-editor-is-restarted-after-removing-and-then-restoring-them))

*   Audio: Chorus and Flange filters didn't apply initial parameters correctly under certain situations when used in the audio mixer or as audio filter components. (579690)
    
*   Audio: Don't play previews when audio is disabled ([1232267](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-assertion-failed-on-expression-is-thrown-while-playing-an-audio-preview-when-unity-audio-is-disabled))

*   Burst: Fix a regression that could break usage of native plugins.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue that prevented burst from resolving functions on platforms when it's statically linked such as iOS.
    
*   CodeEditor: Built-in attributes for JetBrains Annotations have been modernized and include all new annotations (minus ASP/Razor attributes which have no relevance to Unity). For more info on these attributes, see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code\_Analysis\_\_Code\_Annotations.html. ([1208183](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/only-a-small-subset-of-attribute-declarations-are-included-in-unityengine-dot-coremodule-dot-jetbrains-dot-annotations-namespace))
