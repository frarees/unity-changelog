*   iOS: Removed OpenGL ES support on iOS/tvOS
    
*   Package Manager: Added a General Preference option to allow customizing the log level used by the Unity Package Manager for the Editor.log and upm.log files.

*   2D: Allow SpriteShape meshed to be pre computed
    
*   Android: Do basic Application.genuine implementation, where it would check if package name set in Player Settings matches with the one acquired at runtime.
    
*   Android: Moved noCompress settings from launcher project to unitylibrary. (1239760)
    
*   Android: Print Company Name, Product Name in the log during application start, thus if the game is pirated can be used as additional proof that it's your game
    
*   Asset Import: Added support for 3DsMax's Simplified Physical Material from FBX files in the Model Importer.

*   Editor: Removed redundant preview packages message from the title bar.
    
*   Editor: The "user message" for an assert is now shown on the first line when output, so it shows up directly in the Console view, rather than seeing a general "Assertion failure" message and needing to look at expanded details to find it.
    
*   Editor: Unity no longer writes a UTF8 BOM to new scripts it creates (Assets -> Create -> C# Script, etc). BOM's cause problems with various tools, especially those related to source control, and the original reason for this functionality (bad encoding handling in very old editors) has not been a problem for a long time.
    
*   GI: Adding API to set/get the LSA on loaded scenes
    
*   Graphics: Fix necessary memory barriers generated when UAVs are bound as read-only on Nintendo Switch.

*   Graphics: VFX Internal performance test marker
    
*   iOS: Changed the way we generate version defines in trampoline - now we guarantee that they can be compared numerically and all versions are supported (we were missing defines before for bad reasons) ([1244796](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unity-version-in-unitytrampolineconfigure-dot-h-is-higher-in-earlier-unity-versions-compared-to-newer-versions))
    
*   Mobile: Update Mobile Notification verified package version to 1.3.0
    
*   Package Manager: - Package interoperability with Unity IAP: the Unity IAP package can now work directly with the UDP Package instead of maintaining its own UDP dll.

    *   General code refinements.
*   Package Manager: Dependency resolution now automatically resolves trivial conflicts.
    
*   Package Manager: Improved the install from git url visual in the Package Manager window.

*   Shaders: Reduced in-Editor memory usage for Compute shaders.
    
*   UI: Add the ability to have wrap around navigation for horizontal and vertical navigation.
    
*   XR: XR Statistics caches thread-safe stats that only get promoted to 'live' data after a render pass. However a number of data points need to be 'initialized' before we actually render a frame (like Frame Rate).
    

#### Features

*   Asset Pipeline: Consistency check of assets using '-consistencyCheck' and when force reimporting through project window.

Rotation handle arcball rotation outline circle is more visible now. Axis end caps are properly sorted and no longer the further Z axis cap is drawn over the closer X cap. Move tool plane widgets are no longer on the wrong side of the center handle when orthographic camera is used.
    
*   Editor: Naming scheme option was added to project Editor Settings. One of "Prefab (1)" (default), "Prefab.1" or "Prefab\_1", with option for amount of number digits.

*   Editor: Text field for Scripting Define Symbols in ProjectSettings replaced with foldout string array
    
*   Editor: The "user message" for an assert is now shown on the first line when output, so it shows up directly in the Console view, rather than seeing a general "Assertion failure" message and needing to look at expanded details to find it.
    
*   Editor: Unity no longer writes a UTF8 BOM to new scripts it creates (Assets -> Create -> C# Script, etc). BOM's cause problems with various tools, especially those related to source control, and the original reason for this functionality (bad encoding handling in very old editors) has not been a problem for a long time.
    
*   Editor: Updating the UI for Background tasks and Main toolbar.
    
*   GI: Added support for half float texture format for Light Probe Proxy Volume component. The LPPV inspector has a new option to choose the format of the 3D LPPV texture.
