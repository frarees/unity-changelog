#### API Changes

*   2D: Added: Added an overload for GenerateGridSpriteRectangles with an extra parameter (bool keepEmptyRects) to allow users to keep empty rects as Sprites.

    _This is a change to a 2020.2.0 change, not seen in any released version, and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Editor: Pressing Frame Selected second time will focus on the object's handle/gizmo.
    
*   Editor: Scene view "Shaded Wireframe" mode can work with SRPs now, via ScriptableRenderContext.DrawWireOverlay.

    AssetDatabase.GlobalArtifactDependencyVersion  
    AssetDatabase.GlobalArtifactProcessedVersion
    
*   Editor: Add "Enable debugging to all projects" button to "C# Debugger Attached" dialog and made text more descriptive.
    
*   Editor: Add support for Root Namespace field to Assembly Definition Files. New scripts created inside Unity will have a namespace added to the default template if it is set in the corresponding Assembly Definition File or Project Settings -> Editor -> Project Root namespace for non-Assembly Definition File scripts.

*   Package Manager: Added user setting for skipping the 'Asset Store has Moved' window. This setting can be enabled from the 'Asset Store has Moved' window itself. If enabled, this setting will cause the Asset Store to be opened directly in the browser when clicking on 'Window > Asset Store', and the user will not see the 'Asset Store has Moved' window again once they close it.
    
*   Package Manager: Changed Package Details to display full version of package, with tags (i.e. preview). Also, the '(Current)' note has been removed from Release Details of UPM Packages.

*   Package Manager: Package details for packages installed locally/from tarball now displays the path they were installed from.
    
*   Package Manager: Split the package Name into the Name and the organization.
    
*   Package Manager: Updated the Package Manager window visuals with the primary goal to highlight the usage of preview packages.
