*   Kernel: Reduce main thread overhead of creating job reflection data.
    
*   Version Control: Smart Merge (UnityYamlMerge) now sets premerge base to file in correct base values instead of leaving them blank. Blank premerge base values can still be configured - see mergerules.txt for an example

*   Prefabs: Fix: PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset() freezes the editor when called from OnValidate() method. ([1127313](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefabutility-dot-saveasprefabasset-freezes-the-editor-when-called-from-onvalidate-method))

*   Scripting: Allow duplicate enum members to refer to same underlying value as long as one is non-obsolete. ([1218124](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/not-a-valid-textureformat-error-is-thrown-when-creating-astc-format-texture-arrays))
    
*   Scripting: Correct an error in the UnityLinker with System.Text.Json.dll is used. ([1241237](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/code-stripping-standalone-builds-fail-with-unitylinker-dot-exe-errors-when-making-development-builds-with-code-stripping-enabled))

*   Editor: Unity no longer writes a UTF8 BOM to new scripts it creates (Assets -> Create -> C# Script, etc). BOM's cause problems with various tools, especially those related to source control, and the original reason for this functionality (bad encoding handling in very old editors) has not been a problem for a long time.
    
*   Editor: Updated Quick Search to 2.0
    
*   Editor: Updating the UI for Background tasks and Main toolbar.

*   UI: Add the ability to toggle maskable option from the inspector (property has always been there for API only)

*   XR: Updated Oculus XR Plugin to 1.2.0
    
*   XR: XR Statistics caches thread-safe stats that only get promoted to 'live' data after a render pass. However a number of data points need to be 'initialized' before we actually render a frame (like Frame Rate).
