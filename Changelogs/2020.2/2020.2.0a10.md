#### Features

*   Android: Added more complete support for playing video in addressables and asset bundles. Compressed and in-memory bundles are now supported on Android 9 and newer devices.
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Added 2 new properties:  
    AssetDatabase.GlobalArtifactDependencyVersion  
    AssetDatabase.GlobalArtifactProcessedVersion
    
*   Editor: Added -version argument to command line arguments which prints out the unity version to console
    
*   Editor: Added functionality to have snap lines inside Graphview turn on and off in Preferences.  
    If enabled, GraphElements in Graph Views (such as Shader Graph) align with one another when you move them. If disabled, GraphElements move freely.
    
*   Editor: auto\_quitter has been renamed to UnityAutoQuitterauto\_quitter on all platforms. It is now a native program on MacOS and Linux.
    
*   Editor: optionally drag all the edges from a port to another at the same time.
    
*   Editor: Update ProBuilder to 4.2.3.

*   Package Manager: Added user setting for skipping the 'Asset Store has Moved' window. This setting can be enabled from the 'Asset Store has Moved' window itself. If enabled, this setting will cause the Asset Store to be opened directly in the browser when clicking on 'Window > Asset Store', and the user will not see the 'Asset Store has Moved' window again once they close it.
    
*   Package Manager: Changed Package Details to display full version of package, with tags (i.e. preview). Also, the '(Current)' note has been removed from Release Details of UPM Packages.
