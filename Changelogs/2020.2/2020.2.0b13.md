*   Editor: Forces normal windows to open in the active space (on top of the editor) when editor is full screened on mac. This prevents a 'hidden' window. ([1218891](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-floating-windows-open-behind-other-fulls-screen-applications-when-full-screen-editor-is-opened-on-the-external-display))
    
*   Editor: Game tab no longer undocks when switching between tabs while cursor is locked. Cursor no longer locks on focus, only on a click in the Game tab. Also fixes an issue where cursor lock would not function properly (e.g. lock without hiding) when moving docked window to a new location in the editor. All fixes are specific to the editor on Windows. ([1246445](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/game-view-tab-becomes-undocked-when-switching-focus-to-it-from-another-tab-and-cursor-becomes-locked))

*   Editor: When attempting to create a new file beginning with a dot, auto-convert the character to an underscore, similar to what we do for other invalid characters, instead of displaying an error. ([1117029](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-create-a-prefab-when-gameobjects-name-starts-with-a-period))
    
*   Editor: When creating a new asset in the project window of the Editor Unity will now no longer add the required file extension if the entered name already ends with it. So for example creating a script called "Foo.cs" in the project will now create the file "Foo.cs" rather than "Foo.cs.cs". The behaviour when the file extension is omitted is unchanged - creating the script "Foo" will create the file "Foo.cs" as normal.

This PR uses scratch buffer memory for the skin pose buffer thus eliminating the need for an upload operation and the barriers.
    
*   DX12: When reading vertex attributes from vertex buffers (closest hit / any hit shaders), we now fill only the channels that are available instead of returning 0 when trying to read more attribute channels than available.

Move tool plane widgets are no longer on the wrong side of the center handle when orthographic camera is used.
    
*   Editor: Naming scheme option was added to project Editor Settings. One of "Prefab (1)" (default), "Prefab.1" or "Prefab\_1", with option for amount of number digits.

*   Editor: Text field for Scripting Define Symbols in ProjectSettings replaced with foldout string array

*   Editor: The Open context menu will expand the folders in One Column Layout in Project Browser. ([1243843](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/folders-are-opening-when-trying-to-open-them-from-editor))
    
*   Editor: Unity no longer writes a UTF8 BOM to new scripts it creates (Assets -> Create -> C# Script, etc). BOM's cause problems with various tools, especially those related to source control, and the original reason for this functionality (bad encoding handling in very old editors) has not been a problem for a long time.

*   GI: When using com.unity.rendering.hybrid package, force all lightmaps to max atlas size to allow for storing them in texture arrays.
    
*   Graphics: Add Shader Precision Model into Player Settings, to change between current platform defaults and the new Unified Model.
