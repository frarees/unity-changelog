#### Changes

- Android: Updated bundletool up to 1.16.0
    (UUM-70552)

- Burst: Improved error message for pointer-like types in non-`readonly` `static` fields

- Burst: Improved performance of Burst-compiled code in the Windows x64 Editor by only emitting context-saving code when the code being compiled contains a `throw`

- Package: Updated code coverage package to version 1.2.6
