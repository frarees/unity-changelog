### 2021.3.16f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- TextMeshPro: Added support for Color Glyphs and extracting OpenType font features.



#### Improvements

- 2D: Improved performance of TilemapCollider2D.
    (UUM-6046)

- Animation: Reduced the time required to load AnimationClip instances.

- Editor: Improved performance of Handles.DrawAAPolyLine.

- Editor: Improved performance of rendering the Project Settings. It would previously repeatedly query all objects loaded into the editor, which meant that operations that load assets into memory \(entering playmode\) would make the Project Settings unusable slow.

- Graphics: Increased the maximum Async Upload Buffer Size to 2047 MB and updated docs.

- Profiler: Reduced the performance cost of drawing charts in the profiler.

- Shaders: Improved performance of ShaderKeywordSet.IsEnabled\(LocalKeyword\) and ShaderUtil.PassHasKeyword\(...\).

- Video: Report error only when the user uses MediaFoundation directly.



#### Changes

- Text: Upgraded freetype to 2.12.1.
    (UUM-6502)

- Universal RP: Shader parameters used by additional lights are now removed when additional lights are disabled in URP Assets.



#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed Stencil so it now works when rendering sprites with GPU instancing on.

- Android: Fixed issue where "Multithreaded Rendering" is getting disabled after a few Player builds when it should be enabled according to Player Settings.
    (UUM-18385)

- Animation: Fixed issue where, for some playable graphs, the animated displacement of the animated game object would keep accumulating when the game object was disabled and enabled. The original behaviour can be restored with the keepAnimatorStateOnDisable variable.
    ([UUM-3486](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/playables-lose-the-animator-state-when-disabling-a-gameobject-with-playables-attached-to-an-animator))

- Graphics: Fixed RenderTexture assets not accepting texture dimensions greater than 20000 in UI, even though they currently can already go up to 32768 in script if the graphics capabilities allow for it.

- Graphics: Fixed the Read/Write texture import setting becoming grayed out when "Max Size" was greater than 8192, regardless of actual texture dimensions or size. Replaced with an info box when enabling "Read/Write" that triggers if Unity detects a &gt;512MB texture.
