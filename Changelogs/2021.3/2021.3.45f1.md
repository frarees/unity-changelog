- Animation: Fixed crash when attempting to recreate the Animator bindings, by enabling a RigBuilder that binds a transform stream handle for example, while the Animator was being evaluated.
    ([UUM-80043](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-unityengine-animation-setgenericfloatpropertyvalues-when-keyframing-the-rigbuilder-component-to-enabled-and-disabled))

- Apple TV: Fixed Plugin Importer option Add To Embedded Binaries for AppleTV &amp; fat mach-o libs.

- Editor: Added a more descriptive error message if FileUtil::ReplaceDirectory\(\) fails to delete the destination directory.
    ([UUM-62633](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/fileutil-dot-replacedirectory-throws-an-uninformative-error-when-the-destination-path-contains-a-locked-file))

- Editor: F-key functionality restored, and menu items enable/disable correctly.
    ([UUM-83883](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ubuntu-cant-type-the-letter-f))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where Editor menus on macOS could render blank and cause the editor to hang.
    ([UUM-73279](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-menu-sometimes-renders-empty-when-using-help))

- Editor: Fixed crash in Linux when opening recent scenes from the File menu.
    ([UUM-82381](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-crash-on-menucontroller-executemenuitem-when-selecting-recent-scene))

    ([UUM-19440](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-openxr-xrsettings-dot-renderviewportscale-with-urp-give-incorrect-results-when-the-value-is-less-than-1))

- Editor: Fixed safeArea reported value for bottom part of the screen for iOS &lt; 15.
    ([UUM-51667](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-the-safe-area-value-changes-when-reopening-the-app-in-landscape-orientation))

- Editor: Fixed TLS Allocator errors logged when creating new project with 3D template and Connect to Unity Cloud enabled.

- Editor: Switched to using more specific keys for caching splash screens rather than clearing the splash screen cache on all changes. Clearing out the splash screen hash could cause race conditions that would fail a build. If splash screens are not being cached properly you can clear out the cache before a build by deleting the SplashScreenCache folder in the Library.
    ([UUM-41830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-entities-build-fails-with-the-error-asset-has-disappeared-while-building-player-to-globalgamemanagers-dot-assets-path-instancedid-xxxxxx-when-building))

- Graphics: Fixed mesh memory being incorrectly reported in the memory profiler.
    ([UUM-20120](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-mesh-memory-remains-accounted-after-disposal-when-using-mesh-api))

- HDRP: Fixed sun flicker where the sun is close to cloud boundaries.
    ([UUM-70628](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/directional-lights-flicker-when-placed-at-the-edge-of-a-volumetric-cloud))

- IL2CPP: Fixed crash when attaching debugger due to invalid version number.
    (UUM-82249)

- IL2CPP: Fixed issue with the wrong calling convention being used on function pointers when two function pointers with the same signature only differed by calling convention.

- iOS: Fixed logging when using "Wait for the executable to be launched".
    ([UUM-78223](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-logging-does-not-work-when-using-wait-for-the-executable-to-be-launched))

    ([UUM-75124](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-player-freezes-with-a-warning-a-new-orientation-transaction-token-is-being-requested-while-a-valid-one-already-exists-when-orientation-is-changed-during-runtime-on-a-specific-devices))

- iOS: Fixed Unity launching in background on background app activation.
    (UUM-82451)

    ([UUM-73613](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-input-system-does-not-register-some-keys-when-using-international-keyboard-layouts))

- Linux: Fixed Subsequent code executes after a crash.
    ([UUM-77356](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-subsequent-code-executes-after-a-crash))

- macOS: Fixed player not re-launching when doing Build &amp; Run when the application is already running.
    ([UUM-75604](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-player-doesnt-relaunch-when-doing-build-and-run-few-times-in-a-row-without-closing-player))

- Mono: Fixed JIT trampoline memory leak with Timers and Sockets.
    ([UUM-76306](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-leak-when-using-net-sockets))

- Package: Bump the version of LIH to fully delete an empty file. This fixes an issue where automated tests that consume LIH are unstable.

- Particles: Crash with Render triggered from OnEnable.
    ([UUM-74045](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-particlesystemrenderer-updatevertexinputlayout-when-copying-and-pasting-a-prefab-containing-a-specific-particle-system))

- Physics 2D: Fixed an issue where setting the Rigidbody2D.rotation when interpolation is being used results in the wrong Rigidbody2D.position being used for the interpolation resulting in movement discontinuities.
    ([UUM-80058](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rigidbody2d-dot-setrotation-breaks-interpolation-when-resetting-rotation-with-interpolation-enabled))

- Physics 2D: When using Rigidbody2D interpolation and changing the Transform directly, the Transform pose has the priority for interpolation whereas when changing the Rigidbody2D pose directly, the Rigidbody2D pose has the priority over the Transform. This stops "jitter" issues when driving the Rigidbody2D constantly via the Transform. This still isn't a recommended practice however.
    ([UUM-82789](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2d-physics-makes-object-movements-to-flicker))

- Player: Fixed a corner case crash bug on server build player shutdown.
    ([UUM-61775](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-native-crash-occurs-when-closing-the-player-console-window))

- uGUI: Fixed bug where Anchor foldout in RectTransform doesn't get keyboard focus.
    ([UUM-71130](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/field-names-under-anchors-in-the-recttransform-component-dont-get-focused-when-tabbing-through-the-fields))

- Universal RP: Disabled depth priming for cameras with depth only render targets.
    ([UUM-65523](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/no-depth-output-in-play-mode-with-camera-dot-render-when-both-ssao-and-depth-priming-are-enabled))

- Universal RP: Fixed multiview support for the XR Occlusion Mesh pass.
