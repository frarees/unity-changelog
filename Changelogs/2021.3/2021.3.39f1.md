Instead, it is replaced with a warning in the inspector for every tool that involves painting \(Paint Terrain, Paint Trees, Paint Details\). The warning message also includes a button that allows the user to easily add/enable the TerrainCollider component.

- WebGL: Refactored code to have a more robust replacement operation when assembling the framework js file. To achieve this the `String.Replace` operation was set back to a `Regex.Replace`. To account for special characters and regex that may be present in the user jspre code \(see UUM-21896\), the final parameter uses a anonymous delegate function to treat the replacement string as a string literal so that it is not processed in any way.
    ([UUM-67705](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/jspre-files-are-not-included-when-building-for-webgl))

- WebGL: Updated `AudioClip.frequency` to return the effective WebAudio AudioBuffer sampleRate value.
