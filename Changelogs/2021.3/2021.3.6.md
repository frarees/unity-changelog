### 2021.3.6f1 Release Notes

#### Features

-   Package Manager: Related to \[PAX-1772\](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/PAX-1772) As a user I should be able to specify the location of the AssetStore cache

#### Improvements

-   Burst: Support for \_\_Unmanaged for non-extern functions

-   Burst: Used explicit namespace for UnityEditor.PackageManager.Events to avoid conflicts.

-   DX12: Set swapchain background color to make resize visually more pleasing and disable scaling in resize.

-   Windows: Added \"-force-d3d11-flip-model\" command line parameter to force Unity to use DXGI flip model swap chain.

#### API Changes

-   UI Toolkit: Added: Added a NestedInteractionKind enum to ScrollView to give control over event propagation while scrolling.

#### Changes

-   XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 3.0.2.

#### Fixes

-   Android: Allow any file to be selected as keystore (previously only .keystore was supported). ([UUM-917](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/backport-keystore-file-is-not-recognized-by-editor-when-keystore-has-any-other-extension-than-keystore))

-   Android: Fix video with alpha when using Vulkan on some older devices. ([1407184](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-uitoolkit-vp8-webm-video-with-transparency-rendering-as-translucent-in-ui-toolkit))

-   Android: Fixed a potential app store validation issue related to a QueryIntentActivities() call when initializing the engine.

-   Android: Fixed crash during low memory kill. (UUM-4811)

-   Android: Fixed Java local reference leak when AndroidJavaProxy is passed as argument to AndroidJavaObject.Call/CallStatic. ([1389252](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-app-crashes-with-androidruntime-and-local-reference-table-overflow-errors-when-creating-512-androidjavaclass-objects))

-   Android: Fixed Patch (/And Run) failing on some Android 12 devices with \"Permission Denied\" or \"No such file or directory\". (UUM-2445)

-   Asset Bundles: Refactors out the requiresTextureCompression boolean flag.\
    The texture compression setting is now set internally from either the existing EditorPrefs setting kCompressTexturesOnImport or checking if the BuildPipeline build is in progress. (UUM-3653)

-   Burst: A potential issue with the debug info mover pass, that meant it only affected the first entry point in a module.

-   Burst: Added workaround for \"cannot dlopen until fork() handlers have completed\" issue seen in macOS 12.3.

-   Burst: Fixed a bug that manifested when using IAP in UWP builds with Burst - we were scanning the assembly hierarchy too deep for Bursted types, which led to an` AssemblyResolutionException `.

-   Burst: Fixed a bug where using` ReinterpretStore(someIndex, (ushort)someValue) `could cause an internal compiler error in Burst.

-   Burst: Fixed a bug with` Span `and` ReadOnlySpan `types where if the indices used were not already 32-bit signed integers, an internal compiler error would occur if running with safety checks enabled.

-   Burst: Fixed a compiler crash if users used` __refvalue `or` __arglist `in Burst. Neither of these are supported, but now we will nicely tell you via a compiler error that they aren\'t supported.

-   Burst: Fixed a compiler error when trying to acquire the function pointer of a generic function from Bursted code.

-   Burst: Fixed a memory leak where during hashing we\'d pin a GC object and never unpin and free it.

-   Burst: Fixed bug in static constructor ordering in the presence of indirect dependencies between static constructors (i.e. static constructor -\> static method -\> static constructor) that could result in a runtime crash.

-   Burst: Fixed compiler crash when the only usage of a static field was in a formatted exception string.

-   Burst: Fixed compiler crash when trying to dynamically call` BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer `in Burst-compiled code.

-   Burst: Fixed hashing bug that could occur when a function pointer type is used in a method parameter.

-   Burst: Fixed hashing error that could occur in the presence of multiple synthesized explicit interface implementations with the same name and signature.

-   Burst: Fixed hashing error that could occur with unbound generic type.

-   Burst: Using a function only through a C# function pointer could cause a crash.

-   Editor: Fixed Verify Saved Assets modal window to accept changed graphics api. ([1380734](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scene-and-asset-changes-not-saved-when-verify-saving-assets-is-enabled-on-the-linux-editor))

-   Editor: Fixed Verify Saved Assets modal window to accept user input. ([1365765](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graphics-apis-for-linux-reset-to-previous-state-uppon-editor-restart-when-verify-saving-assets-option-is-enabled))

-   Graphics: \"Rim left\" and \"Rim right\" presets are difficult to visualize in the inspector. (1399494)

-   Web: Implemented Application.RequestUserAuthorization/HasUserAuthorization API:\
    https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application.RequestUserAuthorization.html and sets the front facing mode of devices that don\'t include \"front\" or \"back\" in their label to true ([1283191](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-webcamdevice-dot-isfrontfacing-always-returns-false-on-webgl-android))
