#### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed an issue related to using a touchpad with Unity UI scroll rects. Touchpad scrolling is much more sensitive now on Android and Chrome OS. ([1364582](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/chrome-os-touchpad-scrolling-does-not-work-well-with-unity-ui-scroll-rects))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue where a too large of no compress settings list would break apk build procedure. ([1272592](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-build-fails-when-there-are-680-or-more-files-in-the-streaming-assets-folder))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue where Android on-screen keyboard dismiss behavior did not match iOS. (1274669)
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue where Resource.Load did not work when running universal.apk created from AAB which was built with Split Application Binary option enabled. In universal.apk, Bundletool includes only install-time delivered asset packs, so resource loading can still fail if Unity creates fast-follow delivered core data asset pack. (1363907)
    
*   Animation: Fixed animation curve editor swapping unintentionally when editing curves in two different inspectors. ([1308938](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animationcurves-start-to-change-in-the-edit-window-without-selecting-any-options-when-editing-curves-in-two-different-inspectors))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed a crash (due to running out of VRAM) when many textures using DX11 were imported. ([1324536](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-with-system-out-of-memory-error-when-importing-size-heavy-textures))

([1354411](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/double-slash-at-the-end-of-the-assets-folder-path-crashes-editor-when-invoked))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where the main object name in an asset did not update correctly when the asset was moved or copied. ([1210886](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-file-contents-do-not-update-when-it-is-renamed), [1227555](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/renamed-or-duplicated-scriptableobject-contains-old-assets-name-till-saveporject-is-pressed))

*   Audio: Fixed an issue where audio source filters reset on unrelated parameter changes such as audio source volume or pitch and did not respond to component reordering. (1361636)
    
*   Audio: Fixed an issue where exposing multiple send levels in the audio mixer did not working correctly. Previously created mixers with exposed send levels will cause a warning to be logged on editor startup and the send levels will have to be re-exposed. ([1285638](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-mixer-unable-to-expose-other-send-level-parameters-when-one-is-already-exposed))
    
*   Audio: Fixed an issue where the inspector window did not immediately showing the "Wet" slider after selecting "Allow wet mixing" on an effect in the AudioGroup Strip View. (1276039)
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue where LTS builds of the editor did not have their own entry in Add/Remove programs on Windows. ([1267038](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/final-release-versions-are-not-listed-separately-in-programs-and-features-list-of-applications-in-the-system))

([1283506](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-cursor-dot-lockstate-registers-input-movement-to-center-when-mouse-is-moved))
