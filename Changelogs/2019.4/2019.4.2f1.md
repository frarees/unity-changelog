#### API Changes

*   iOS: Deprecated: Deprecated  
    1.  UnityEngine.iOS.LocalNotification  
        
    2.  UnityEngine.iOS.RemoteNotification  
        
    3.  UnityEngine.iOS.NotificationServices
*   iOS: Following Apple's obsoletion of GKPlayer.playerID, IUserProfile.id now returns GKPlayer.teamPlayerID for devices on >= iOS 12.4 (Apple's recommended replacement) , and GKPlayer.playerID for devices below that (that won't have teamPlayerID and gamePlayerID available until they upgrade). This will impact any data that is stored using the old ID. We are working on exposing the obsolete GKPlayer.playerID to ease migration.

#### Changes

*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.2.15

#### Improvements

*   Android: Improve performance of constant buffer memory access on Adreno devices when using Vulkan (1248891)

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.4 or higher.

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
