([1323499](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-gets-stuck-in-import-loop-when-creating-an-asset-during-initializeonload-with-entities-package-installed))

*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which could sometimes lead to missing files in successfully resolved packages in projects with a large number of packaged assets.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which prevented starting `UnityPackageManager.exe` on Windows when its path contained non-ANSI Unicode characters. ([1317244](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-wont-start-with-unicode-install-path))

([1313413](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/offset-is-outside-the-valid-range-error-is-thrown-when-setting-the-particles-with-the-same-variables-as-getting-them))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue where setting an array of null bone transforms to a SkinnedMeshRenderer via the 'bones' property, would cause a crash if a Cloth component was present on the same GameObject. ([1328023](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-when-cloth-with-skinnedmeshrenderer-has-null-bone-references))
    
*   Physics: Fixed inertia tensor not updating when a collider is removed. ([937998](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inertia-tensor-is-not-reset-when-a-collider-is-removed))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed changing the GUID of a Prefab in Prefab Mode in isolation triggers different issues.
    
*   Profiler: Fixed Profiler Window CPU Usage chart highlighting selected sample in all frames.
    
*   Scene Manager: Fixed an issue to prevent loading scene where multiple objects have same identifier. ([1249893](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-unpackprefabinstancerecursive-when-entering-play-mode-in-a-scene-with-broken-prefabs))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Fixed SceneView.rotation value incorrectly affecting camera rotation in 2D mode. ([1314928](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cameras-z-position-is-clamped-to-zero-when-in-scene-view))

    \-cacheServerNamespacePrefix argument. ([1294806](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/accelerator-namespace-not-added-when-opening-project-with-cacheservernamespaceprefix-argument))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed a crash when PrimitiveID is the only input to a stage. ([1289378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/internal-error-communicating-with-the-shader-compiler-process-when-sv-primitiveid-is-the-only-input-signature))
    
*   UI Elements: Fixed problem with inspector redrawing unnecessarily.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed word suggestion not appearing in the Windows On Screen Keyboard when editing an InputField or TextMeshPro control. ([1332468](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uwp-word-suggestions-arent-displayed-when-entering-text-into-an-inputfield-slash-tmp-via-softkeyboard))
    
*   Windows: Fixed an issue whereby X86\_64 is now the default Windows architecture. ([1283651](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/default-architecture-in-build-settings-is-x86-instead-of-x64))
