-   AI Navigation: NavMesh::Raycast freezes the whole editor in an infinite loop on Application.UpdateScene ([UUM-2496](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/navmesh-raycast-freezes-the-whole-editor-in-an-infinite-loop-on-application-dot-updatescene))

### 2019.4.40f1 Release Notes

#### Features

-   Asset Pipeline: Accelerator Corruption Detection.

#### Fixes

-   2D: Fixed \'require texture compression\' setting being reset during player build. ([1397965](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-size-increased-on-first-build-when-compress-textures-slash-assets-on-import-is-enabled))

-   AI: Fixed unidirectional NavMesh links creating erroneous connection between polygons. ([1328727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unidirectional-navmeshlink-results-in-navmeshagents-pathing-incorrectly))

-   Android: Fixed a Unity Audio bug related to Bluetooth audio. This was causing issues with Vivox, and possibly other 3rd part audio libraries, with Bluetooth functionality. On Android, Bluetooth audio state is basically global, so Unity Audio now only makes the bare minimum changes to this state. We may still call startBluetoothSco and stopBluetoothSco when starting or re-initializing the audio output engine and when starting/stopping the Unity microphone. We may also call AudioManager.setMode when starting/stopping a Bluetooth mic through the Unity microphone APIs, but that\'s it. (1418634)

-   Android: Fixed app-freezing when an application changes into multi-window(split-screen) on Chrome OS tablet mode. (1361131)

-   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where MonoScripts in plugins that were dependent on plugins in other folders could fail to import when reimporting all assets. ([1411256](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scripts-are-missing-after-importing-a-custom-package))

-   Audio: Fixed an issue that the Windows Editor no longer tries to link with the MP3 LAME library, which it does not use directly.

-   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where cached Sprite state could be stale.

-   DX12: Fixed an issue to offset binding support for cbuffers disabled from SystemInfo on DX12 as it has never been supported. ([1381731](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/painting-terrain-details-result-in-a-crash-when-using-directx12))

-   Editor: Fixed IMGUI state being reset when a EditorUtility.DisplayDialog was opened. ([1380288](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-exception-after-calling-editorutility-dot-displaydialog-from-reorderablelist-item-propertydrawer))

-   Editor: Fixed reflection probe baking sometimes containing the cyan loading shader. ([1368213](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-shader-is-picked-when-allowasynccompilation-equals-false-and-async-compilation-is-ongoing))

-   GI: Fixed an issue that the light probe now produces valid output when punctual light overlaps it. ([1242829](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/point-lights-have-no-guard-when-light-probes-are-near-or-overlapping-them-in-progressive-lightmapper))

-   Graphics: Fixed hang on repeated calls to GraphicsBuffer.CopyCount. ([1353308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-with-graphicsbuffer-dot-copycount-on-dx11-with-intel-integrated-graphics))

-   Graphics: Fixed incompatible render pass validation error in built-in pipeline project when graphics API is set to Vulkan. (1355666)

-   Input: Fixed InputSystem.QueueStateEvent throwing exceptions when called from non-main thread. ([1348778](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-new-inputsystem-queuestateevent-cannot-be-called-from-another-thread))

-   Input: Fixed keyboard not working on iOS 15. ([1376970](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/keyboard-input-is-not-working-when-using-an-external-keyboard-in-ios-15))

-   Input: Fixed keys being stuck pressed when application regains focus on Windows Standalone, macOS with input system package. ([1361145](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ispressed-keeps-returning-true-when-it-was-true-before-minimizing-the-build-window))

-   Input: Fixed mouse coordinates being incorrect until first move on Windows Standalone, Linux, macOS with input system package. ([1231907](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-coordinates-reported-as-00-until-the-first-move))

-   Input: Fixed PrintScreen key reported as pressed when pressing Insert/Home/Del/etc with NumLock being off with Input System package on Windows (also modified UWP and GDK). ([1359217](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/certain-input-system-keys-trigger-prtscn-with-either-numlock-on-or-off))

-   Input: Fixed Touchscreen.pressure being corrupted on Windows Standalone with input system package. ([1378194](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/touchscreen-dot-pressure-memory-not-cleared-leading-to-nan-value))

-   Input System: Fixed incorrect Windows input event timestamps. ([1284586](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputinteractioncontext-dot-timerhasexpired-property-breaks-in-editor-after-pc-left-sleep-mode))

-   iOS: Fixed a bug with the \"Force iOS Speakers when Recording\" player setting. In addition, a few other iOS Bluetooth audio bugs were fixed. When starting up with Bluetooth headphones connected, audio output used to play through the built-in speakers (which was an error). The list of available microphones was not always correct when connecting / dis-connecting Bluetooth headphones at runtime. Bluetooth microphone input was really choppy. ([1387403](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sound-is-playing-through-the-ear-speaker-if-using-force-ios-speakers-when-recording-when-prepare-ios-for-recording-is-on))

-   Kernel: Fixed issue when attempting to load corrupted rest-certificate.pem cert would crash Unity. ([1423569](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-crashes-on-stackwalker-getcurrentcallstack-when-rest-certificate-dot-pem-is-corrupted))

-   Linux: Fixed an issue where calling SetResolutionImmediate in HDRP would display blue. (1309848)

-   Networking: Fixed IPv6 UnityWebRequest support on Windows and Android. ([1409484](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-webrequest-does-not-work-when-enabling-only-ipv6))

-   Profiler: Fixed System Used Memory reporting useless system and not app memory usage. ([1267773](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/total-system-memory-usage-in-the-profiler-is-very-different-with-different-devices-with-the-same-build))

-   Scene Manager: Fixed an issue to aligne scene and instantiation behavior when loading a new scene between Editor and Build. ([1046181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/activescene-differs-between-editor-and-build-when-loading-a-new-scene))

-   Version Control: Fixed an editor hang when entering Play Mode.

-   Video: Fixed a crash on UnityMain when building for server with active VideoPlayer in Scene. ([1350949](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-unitymain-when-building-for-server-with-active-videoplayer-in-scene))

-   Video: Fixed an Editor crashes when playing a video file with 14 audio tracks in Play mode. ([1371522](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-sdk-editor-crashes-when-playing-a-video-file-with-14-audio-tracks-in-play-mode))

-   Video: Fixed an issue that the VideoPlayer throws errors when VideoClip loaded from AssetBundle nears the end. ([1358843](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/videoplayer-throws-errors-when-videoclip-loaded-from-assetbundle-nears-the-end))

-   Video: Fixed an issue that the Videos fail to play on Standalone Windows players with some AMD GPUs. ([1389338](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/videos-fail-to-play-on-standalone-windows-players-with-some-amd-gpus))

-   Video: Fixed an issue VideoPlayer.width and height return 0 instead of expected values. ([1339883](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-videoplayer-dot-width-and-height-returns-0-when-videoplayer-dot-texture-dot-width-and-height-returns-expected-values))

Also fixed another issue where video clips that browser blocked from autoplaying would not start playing after user interacts with the web page. ([1241582](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-video-audio-is-being-played-when-videoplayers-audio-output-mode-is-set-to-none))
