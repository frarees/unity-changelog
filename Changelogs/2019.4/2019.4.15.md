### 2019.4.15f1 Release Notes

#### Fixes

-   AI: Correct the stray NavMeshAgent to always move to the closest NavMesh instead of somewhere above or below. ([1072945](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-navmeshagent-gameobject-teleports-to-a-near-navmeshsurface-when-collided-with-a-moving-navmeshobstacle))

-   Android: Enabled Unity perform Android SDK update with elevated privileges on Windows. Previously if Android SDK/NDK would be installed in folder like Program Files, Unity wouldn\'t be able to update Android SDK.

([1284525](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-il2cpp-empty-project-crashes-on-launch-with-using-memoryadresses-from-more-than-16gb-of-memory-messages))

-   Editor: Added a new prompt for a user to attach a managed debugger when on Linux, on a headless server build. Also prevents timeout to attach Profiler triggering when allowDebugging is set. ([1274332](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-short-fixed-time-is-given-to-attach-the-debugger-when-launching-player-built-with-server-build-and-script-debugging-enabled))

-   Package Manager: The Packager Manager no longer fails to write the project manifest file (` Packages/manifest.json `) or the lock file (` Packages/packages-lock.json `) when they are read-only. ([1263361](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-manager-doesnt-ask-if-manifest-dot-json-and-packages-lock-dot-json-files-should-be-made-writable-when-opening-a-project))

-   Physics: Ensure that changing a Rigidbody2D constraint on a prefab instance results in the change being indicated by a bold label in the inspector. ([1265836](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/component-variables-label-text-is-not-bolded-when-editing-prefabs-rigidbody2d-constraints))

-   Profiler: Fixed an issue where FrameCount inside the ProfilerUserSettings would clamp to a 0 - 2000 frame range instead of 300 - 2000, thus causing the charts inside the ProfilerWindow to throw out of range exceptions. (1288878)

-   Profiler: Fixed issue where entering PlayMode with the editor open would throw \"GetInt is not allowed error\". ([1289794](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-getint-is-not-allowed-error-is-thrown-when-entering-the-play-mode-while-profiler-is-recording-the-editor))

-   Scripting: Fixed issue where thread statics that reused thread static slots would not adhere to type alignment. This would cause the garbage collector to incorrectly clean up thread static data because it would only scan pointer aligned memory for references. This would lead to memory becoming corrupted and inducing random crashes. ([1266322](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mono-class-fill-runtime-generic-context-when-entering-play-mode-repeatedly))

-   UI: Canvas RectTransform size calculation now done for standalone renders as well. Camera needs to be enabled to pick up the RenderTexture size change. ([833456](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/canvas-dot-forceupdatecanvases-doesnt-update-canvas-before-camera-dot-render-is-called))

-   Video: Fixed to crash when destroying VideoPlayer while it is still initializing. (1241848)

-   WebGL: Fixed WebGL build issue when the default system Python version is Python3 instead of Python2. (1280386)

-   XR: Backport trunk fix to 2019.4. Utilize volume up and down buttons on VR devices to confirm and proceed when Android dialog is not visible on VR devices instead of only restricting to click \"Ok\" button on screen. ([1140155](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/oculus-go-managed-debugger-dialog-cannot-be-interacted-with-when-launching-the-application))

-   XR: Correct mismatched Vulkan framebuffer and renderpass configurations that caused validation errors, and issues with rendering when using multiple rendering passes.

-   XR: Fixed an issue where the XR splash screen is missing when using SRP. ([1230976](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-xrsdk-oculus-go-oculus-quest-virtual-reality-splash-image-doesnt-show-up-with-new-xr-sdk))

-   XR: Fixed Hololens 2 apps pausing when carry along apps are open.

-   XR: Fixed issue when using deferred rendering and stereo multipass where if the spotlight intersected the camera near and camera far planes then the spotlight would render incorrectly in the right eye. ([1140490](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vr-spot-light-render-is-cut-in-the-right-eye-of-an-hmd-when-using-deferred-multi-pass-and-light-range-far-clip-plane))

-   XR: Fixed issue where attempting to use separate cameras while using stereo multipass to render each eye caused the left eye to render the right eye and the right eye to not render at all. ([1280266](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-mockhmd-lefteye-isnt-rendered-correctly-when-stereo-camera-is-separated-to-left-slash-right-with-multipass-rendering))

-   XR: Fixed stereo skybox rendering when a sphere is used instead of a cube. ([1223567](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-skybox-skybox-rendering-does-not-respect-far-plane-setting-occluding-the-scene-object-in-xr))

#### API Changes

-   Physics: Added: Added writeable WheelCollider.sprungMass, to enable explicit mass distributions. In addition to that, expose WheelCollider.ResetSprungMasses() to reset the vehicle back to automatically calculated implicit sprung masses. It\'s the same usage pattern as with Rigidbody.inertiaTensor / Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor().

#### Changes

-   Package Manager: Temporarily removed the Burst compiler warning about exception throws not in \[Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")\] methods, to let us address user feedback. The next minor version of Burst will reincorporate this in a more friendly manner.

#### Improvements

-   IL2CPP: Improved error message when required Visual Studio components are not installed when building for Windows.

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)
