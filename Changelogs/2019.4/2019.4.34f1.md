*   Android: Fixed an GLSL compile error when using a particle system with instancing. ([1255008](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-a-glsl-error-occurs-when-using-the-unity-particle-system))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue that IBeginDragHandler.OnBeginDrag and IDragHandler.OnDrag is now triggered when using Samsung S-Pen. ([1364109](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-samsung-s-pen-ibegindraghandler-dot-onbegindrag-and-idraghandler-dot-ondrag-is-not-triggered-when-using-samsung-s-pen))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue that the stylus input is now treated as a touch rather than mouse in the older input system. ([1246579](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/samsung-s-pen-touches-are-not-registered-when-samsung-s-pen-is-used-to-touch-screen))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue that touches are now registered when Samsung S Pen is used to touch screen. ([1370814](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-samsung-s-pen-input-dot-mouseposition-stops-updating-when-the-s-pen-is-used-on-a-samsung-device))
    
*   Android: Fixed Java local reference leaking in UnityWebRequest, VideoPlayer. ([1297185](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-using-videoplayer-dot-prepare-and-calling-10000-unitywebrequests-causes-the-app-to-crash-at-android-7-dot-0-or-lower))
    
*   Android: Fixed screen safe area values at startup. ([1327752](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/safearea-when-device-is-held-in-portrait-app-is-running-in-portrait-upside-down-windowed-mode-safearea-values-are-incorrect))

*   Editor: Fixed an issue that the DontSaveInEditor now works as intended on Prefab instances. ([1363573](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/instantiated-fbx-through-code-throws-error-after-leaving-play-mode))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed the order of operations for Thread Volatile Read and Write. ([1373882](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-thread-volatileread-is-added-to-build-instead-of-volatileread-when-calling-thread-dot-volatileread))
    
*   Input System: Fixed a performance issue on entering/exiting play-mode where HID device capabilities JSON could be parsed multiple times for a single device. ([1362733](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-package-deserializing-json-multiple-times-when-entering-slash-exiting-playmode))
    
*   Input System: Fixed a problem where explicitly switching to the already active control scheme and device set for `PlayerInput` would cancel event callbacks and the control scheme switch would have no effect. This fix detects and skips device unpairing and re-pairing if the switching is detected to not be a change to scheme or devices. ([1342297](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-button-clicks-are-missed-when-using-switchcurrentcontrolscheme-inside-of-onmousedown))

*   Input System: Fixed an error "Default constructor not found for type UnityEngine.InputSystem.iOS.LowLevel.iOSStepCounter" and any other potential exceptions due to classes, methods, fields and properties being stripped when managed stripping setting set to medium or high. ([1368761](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-new-input-system-iosstepcounter-crash-on-launch-with-managed-stripping))
    
*   Input System: Fixed an issue that broke the `VirtualMouseInput` component in the editor. ([1367553](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vitrualmouseinput-stickaction-doesnt-work))

([1354098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-errors-are-thrown-when-disconnecting-controller-while-holding-a-button-with-press-and-release-set-up-separately))
    
*   Input System: Fixed an issue where resetting an action via `InputAction.Reset()` while being in disabled state would prevent the action from being enabled again. ([1370732](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-input-system-disable-reset-enable-makes-controls-being-disabled-forever))
    
*   Input System: Fixed current being `null` for sensors (`Accelerometer.current`, others). ([1371204](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/accelerometer-not-working-when-using-input-system-1-dot-1-1))
    
*   Input System: Fixed input action for Android gamepad's right stick. Now it is correctly invoked when only the Y-axis is changing. ([1308637](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-input-system-right-analog-stick-tracking-is-erratic-when-using-a-gamepad-connected-to-an-android-device))
    
*   Input System: Fixed unhandled exceptions in `InputManager.OnUpdate` failing latter updates with `InvalidOperationException: Already have an event buffer set! Was OnUpdate() called recursively?`. These exceptions will be handed now and the application will try to recover into a working state.
    
*   Input System: Fixed `action.ReadValue` and others returning invalid data when used from `FixedUpdate` or early update when running in play mode in the editor. ([1368559](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/enter-key-is-not-registered-when-using-waspressedthisframe-with-input-system-1-dot-1-1))
    
*   Input System: Improved the user experience when creating single vs multi-touch touchscreen bindings in the Input Action Asset editor by making both options visible in the input action dropdown menu. Now it's not neccessary to be aware of the touch\\\*/press path binding syntax. ([1357664](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-touchscreens-multi-touch-doesnt-work-when-using-a-custom-inputactionasset))
    
*   iOS: Fixed a crash/hang when going to background from portrait upside down on some devices. ([1285042](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-app-is-crashing-when-it-is-switched-out-of-focus-and-focused-again-while-it-is-in-reverse-portrait))
    
*   iOS: Fixed a hang/crash issue on iOS when a call comes in. ([1368258](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-an-incoming-call-notification-sometimes-freezes-unity-app-on-ios-15))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where wrong asset store version on package details are displayed. (1381089)
    
*   Profiler: Fixed an issue where Profiler might lose metadata for markers spanned across multiple frames. (1288339)
    
*   Project Browser: Fixed an issue that the Project Browser slider is now correctly restored when clearing the search field after selecting a favorite filter. ([1348825](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/project-browser-slider-doesnt-get-reset-after-selecting-any-item-in-favorites-hierarchy-and-clearing-the-search-bar))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed an issue where running in batch mode with a different build target than precedent run would not trigger a script recompilation. ([1380097](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/batch-mode-compilation-error-on-first-launch-of-android-batch-build-results-in-unity-closing-with-non-zero-exit-code))
    
*   Serialization: Fixed missed invocations of ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialization and asserts arising when that interface is implemented on structs inside a MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject class, along with the presence of SerializeReference fields. ([1372710](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-error-is-thrown-when-calling-resources-dot-loadall-together-with-linq-expressions))
    
*   Terrain: Fixed unnecessary CPU time spent in culling terrain trees with LOD. ([1256992](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/terrain-trees-are-not-being-culled-by-the-cameras-view-transform-therefore-having-the-same-lower-performance))
    
*   Version Control: Fixed console error when selecting object in Scene view hierarchy or creating a new asset.
    
*   Version Control: Fixed NullReferenceException after closing the Plastic SCM window.
    
*   Version Control: Fixed UI overlays in Project view missing on changed assets when force checkout is disabled.

([1357597](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-are-spammed-in-the-console-upon-opening-imported-video-in-the-inspector-tab-when-target-platform-is-set-to-uwp))
    
*   WebGL: Fixed a playback issue of videos on iOS. ([1288692](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-ios-video-is-not-playing-on-ios))
    
*   WebGL: Fixed an issue with fullscreen mode on Safari. ([1347304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-fullscreen-mode-does-not-expand-the-players-window-fully-and-has-black-edges-when-using-safari))
