### 2020.3.10f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Asset Import: Improved overall performance of FBX files import.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved performance of ASCII FBX files import.
    
*   Graphics: Optimized static batching process, e.g. entering play mode with 30k static batched objects in the editor is faster by two seconds.
    
*   Graphics: Static batching and Mesh.CombineMeshes can handle more vertex formats now, for example Float16 normals or UVs. It also no longer clamps vertex colors to UNorm8 format - if input meshes have higher precision vertex colors, then combined mesh will have high precision colors too. ([1274815](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-triggered-by-mesh-dot-combinemeshes-when-underlying-meshs-vertex-format-has-changed))
    
*   macOS: Updated xcode project template to use "modern" build system. ([1326316](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-xcode-legacy-build-system-will-be-removed-when-future-xcode-version-is-released))
    

#### Changes

*   Editor: Updated Collaborate package to allow users to migrate to Plastic.
    
*   Package: Updated the com.unity.purchasing package to version 3.1.0.
