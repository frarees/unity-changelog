### 2020.3.17f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Android: Added more complete support for running Android apps on the Chrome OS platform. These changes enable building and running Android on x86 and x86-64 CPUs, now officially supported on Chrome OS devices. These changes also include input-related and windowing improvements for Chrome OS.

#### Improvements

*   Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch "platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold" that can be used to specify which CPU cores are treated as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.
    
*   Graphics: Improve Line/TrailRenderer quality when points are close together. ([1322317](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linerenderer-does-not-render-lines-straight-when-positions-are-under-1-or-over-1))
    
*   Graphics: Reduced the Input delay in Vulkan standalone when VSync is enabled. ([1282463](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/noticable-mouse-and-keyboard-input-delay-on-a-vulkan-standalone-build-when-vsync-is-enabled))
    
*   Package: Update Addressables to 1.18.9 and SBP to 1.19.0
    
*   Particles: Optimize Mesh data stripping vertex channels that are used by particle systems when the mesh is included in assetbundles. ([1313420](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/addressables-vertex-data-is-lost-when-mesh-is-marked-as-addressable-and-play-mode-script-is-set-to-use-existing-build-1))
    

#### API Changes

*   Asset Bundles: Added: Adding new API DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.autoLoadAssetBundle for loading AssetBundles asynchronously from DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.
    
*   Services: Added: Added new com.unity.services.core package that is used for common behaviour of Game Service packages
    
*   XR: Added: Added IUnityGraphicsVulkanV2 plugin interface to add support for chaining vulkan initialization intercepts. (1349908)
    

#### Changes
