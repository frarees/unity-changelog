### 2020.3.43f1 Release Notes

#### Features

- Editor: Added Enable PlayMode Tooltips toggle to preferences.



#### Improvements

- Animation: Optimized AnimationClip size calculation reducing asset load time in the Editor.

- Animation: Reduced the time required to load AnimationClip instances.

- Editor: Improved performance of rendering the Project Settings. It would previously repeatedly query all objects loaded into the editor, which meant that operations that load assets into memory \(entering playmode\) would make the Project Settings unusable slow.

- Graphics: Increased the maximum Async Upload Buffer Size to 2047 MB and updated docs.

- Version Control: Added offline mode toggle for smoother offline experience.

- Video: Report error only when the user uses MediaFoundation directly.



#### API Changes

- Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.computeSubGroupSize API, allows users to query the size of the compute thread group that supports efficient memory sharing on the GPU.

- Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.maxTexture3DSize API, allows users to query the largest 3D Texture size that the graphics hardware supports.

- Graphics: Added: SystemInfo.maxTextureArraySlices API, allows users to query the maximum number of slices in a Texture array that the graphics hardware supports.
