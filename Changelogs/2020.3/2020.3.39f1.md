#### Changes

*   IAP: # Changelog  
    \## \[4.4.0\] - 2022-07-11  
    \### Added  
    
    *   GooglePlay - Google Play Billing Library version 4.0.0.  
        
    *   The Multi-quantity feature is not yet supported by the IAP package and will come in a future update. **Do not enable `Multi-quantity` in the Google Play Console.**  
        
    *   Add support for  
        the \[IMMEDIATE\_AND\_CHARGE\_FULL\_PRICE\](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingFlowParams.ProrationMode#IMMEDIATE\_AND\_CHARGE\_FULL\_PRICE)  
        proration mode. Use `GooglePlayProrationMode.ImmediateAndChargeFullPrice` for easy access.  
        \### Fixed  
        
    *   GooglePlay - Fix `IGooglePlayConfiguration.SetDeferredPurchaseListener`  
        and `IGooglePlayConfiguration.SetDeferredProrationUpgradeDowngradeSubscriptionListener` callbacks sometimes not being  
        called from the main thread.  
        
    *   GooglePlay - When configuring `IGooglePlayConfiguration.SetQueryProductDetailsFailedListener(Action retryCount)`, the action will be invoked with retryCount starting at 1 instead of 0.  
        
    *   GooglePlay - Added a validation when upgrading/downgrading a subscription that calls `IStoreListener.OnPurchaseFailed` with `PurchaseFailureReason.ProductUnavailable` when the old transaction id is empty or null. This can occur when attempting to upgrade/downgrade a subscription that the user doesn't own.
*   IAP: # Changelog  
    \## \[4.4.1\] - 2022-08-11  
    \### Fixed

    *   Amazon - Set android:export to true to support Android API level 31+
*   Package: Bumped versions of Relay & QoS packages.
    
*   Text: Upgraded freetype to 2.12.1. (UUM-6502)
