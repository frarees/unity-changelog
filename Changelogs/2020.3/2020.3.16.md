#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.13+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

-   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.13+ and Xcode 9.0 or higher.

-   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK

##### For running Unity games

Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

-   Desktop:

    -   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.13+, Ubuntu 18.04+
    -   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    -   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

-   iOS player requires iOS 11.0 or higher.

-   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.

-   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities

-   Exported Android Gradle projects require Android Studio 3.4 and later to build
