### Preview of Final 6000.4.0b2 Release Notes

#### Features

- 2D: D2D-7595<br>
    Runtime SpriteAtlas is to optimize game performance by dynamically creating and managing sprite atlases at runtime.

- Audio: Enabled the Android plugin for Enhanced AudioFoundation.

- Editor: Added a slider to the Mesh Renderer and Skinned Mesh Renderer components that lets you visualize and scrub through different Mesh levels of detail \(LOD\) in the Inspector.

- Editor: Added an ''LOD label' toggle to the Scene view Gizmo menu to control the visibility of all Level of Detail \(LOD\) labels for Mesh LOD.

- Editor: Added an option in Animator State Machines to evaluate transitions on start. When enabled, the Animator will evaluate entry transitions before initializing the default state. If one of the transitions is valid, the Animator will be initialized in that state. If this option is disabled, or if no transition is valid upon initialization, the Animator will start in the default state. This option will default to true for newly created AnimatorControllers \(and AnimatorStateMachines\), and default to false for existing assets to avoid unexpected changes in behaviour.

- Editor: Added support for dragging and dropping materials onto a Terrain GameObject in the Editor.

- Editor: Added support for dragging and dropping Terrain Layers onto a Terrain GameObject in the Editor.

    ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))

- Plugins: Upgraded the NVIDIA DLSS SDK from version 3.1.3 to 3.1.4. This update includes bug fixes and stability improvements.

Previously, this setup required custom shaders and custom scripts to bind shader property values to each Terrain material before rendering.

- Test Framework: Implemented a debounced search in the Test Runner window to improve search performance for projects with many tests.
    ([UUM-119308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/test-runner-window-search-is-slow-in-projects-with-a-lot-of-tests))

- UI Toolkit: Improved support for `StyleSheet` resources to allow sub-assets to be referenced using a hash. For example: `property: resource(path#sub-asset-name)`.
    ([UUM-112869](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-builder-cant-set-a-background-image-to-a-sprite-from-a-multi-sprite-spritesheet-in-the-resources-folder))

- Universal RP: Removed the final post-processing pass when using Spatial-Temporal Post-processing \(STP\) to improve GPU and CPU performance.

- Universal RP: Split monolithic post-processing logic into reusable modular post-process pass classes.

- URP: Added logging for SDR rendering configuration when 10-Bit HDR Output is active. This helps you understand what to expect and any automatic adjustments URP makes. Refer to \[Use Standard Dynamic Range \(SDR\) Rendering with HDR Output enabled\]\(https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.3/Documentation/Manual/urp/post-processing/hdr-output.html\) for more details.
    (UUM-115727)

- URP: Added some small user experience \(UX\) improvements to the Render Pipeline Converter.
    (UUM-115317)

- URP: In the Render Pipeline Converter, Readonly Material converter now changes references to material inside custom materials.
    ([UUM-114971](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/render-pipeline-converter-readonly-material-converter-does-not-change-custom-components-references))

#### Changes

- DX12: Modified the DirectX 12 \(DX12\) device filter to also filter out integrated GPUs.

- Editor: Added `Hide Classic Platforms` option to `Project Settings` &gt; `Editor` to hide classic platforms from the Build Profile list.

- Editor: Changed LookDev so that its temporary Volume Profile is released from memory when no longer in use.
    ([UUM-125389](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/previously-deleted-defaultlookdevprofile-is-present-when-upgrading-the-editor-version))

- Editor: Changed the artifact dependency to `ImportResultOutputID` from `ImportResultID`. This created a more specific dependency that reduces the number of imports when an asset is changed. If the output of an import doesn't change, any asset with an artifact dependency to that asset is no longer reimported. As part of this change, the artifact database version was updated, which triggers a reimport of all assets in a project.

- Editor: Improved the interaction between the EditorApplication play mode API and the PlayModeScenariosManager API to ensure more predictable behavior. Before a scenario runs, entering Play Mode via the EditorApplication API now resets the active scenario to default. While a scenario is active, attempts to alter the Play Mode state using the EditorApplication API are now prevented to avoid potential errors and undefined behavior.

- Editor: Moved headers for developing Native Plugins in the macOS Editor from `Unity.app/Contents/PluginAPI` to `Unity.app/Contents/Resources/PluginAPI`.

- Editor: Removed the behavior where a `line` parameter was interpreted as a context object to enter the Prefab Stage. Use the \[`SceneManagement.PrefabStageUtility.OpenPrefab`\]\(https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.PrefabStageUtility.OpenPrefab.html\) API to open a Prefab in the Prefab Stage.

- Editor: Using `SerializeReference` now also issues a warning if used on a class whose parent doesn't have the `[Serializable]` attribute.

- Entities: Embedded the `com.unity.entities.entities` package in Unity as a core package. The package version now aligns with the Unity Editor version.

- Entities Graphics: Embedded the `com.unity.entities.graphics` package in Unity as a core package. The package version now aligns with the Unity Editor version.

- Graphics: Removed the PVRTC compressor from the Editor. Projects that previously used the PVRTC compressor now use the ETC2 compressor.

- iOS: Added support to pause and unpause DisplayLink when the application moved to the background or foreground.

- Kernel: Embedded the `com.unity.entities.collections` package in Unity as a core package. The package version now aligns with the Unity Editor version.

- macOS: Updated the minimum requirements for the macOS Player to macOS 12 \(Monterey\).

- Physics: Added minimum width and height constraints to the *Physics Debugger* window.
    ([UUM-114638](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/physics-debugger-window-has-no-minimum-width-slash-height-set))

    (UUM-129614)

- Universal RP: Deprecated the Intermediate Texture Mode *Always* setting. The only supported setting is now *Auto*. The setting was removed from the Universal Render Pipeline \(URP\) Renderer asset for any project that had it set to the default value of *Auto*.

- URP: Modified Universal Render Pipeline HDR Output behavior to maintain 16-bit HDR Output when switching to Render Pipeline Assets that don't support HDR Rendering.
    (UUM-115727)

- URP: Updated the Render Pipeline Converter window to improve organization. Converters are now grouped into two main categories:<br>
    *   Pipeline Converter<br>
    *   Pipeline Tools

- Version Control: Improved overlay icons to align with the Unity Editor design. Added icons for "Controlled" and "Changed" items, removed the icon for "Private" items, and added a "Contains Changes" overlay for directories containing changes.
