*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras\]\[RuleOverrideTile\] Create instance Tile on override.
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras\]\[RuleTileEditor\] Add blank space to the end of the Rule list.
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras\]\[RuleTileEditor\] Add drag and drop rect for Sprites to create initial TilingRules.
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras\]\[RuleTileEditor\] Add field to change number of TilingRules.

*   Burst: Burst now generates a link.xml automatically to avoid issues with stripping causing missing symbols at runtime from static constructor usage.
    
*   Burst: Burst now waits for all threads to complete on shutdown, rather than performing a thread abort, as that could lead to a race condition with Dispose.
    
*   Burst: Changed the optimization pipeline to run the loop unroller _exclusively_ after the loop vectorizer. This improves codegen in a lot of cases (mostly because the SLP vectorizer is unable to vectorize all the code that the loop unroller could have).

*   Burst: Made the `SharedStatic` initialization cost during static constructor initialization time 13.3x faster.
    
*   Burst: Made `fmod` and floating-point modulus use a faster algorithm to improve performance.

*   Burst: Upgraded the minimum supported PS4 SDK to 8.00.
    
*   Editor: Removing most Device Simulator devices from the editor. All devices can be added by installing the com.unity.device-simulator.devices package.
    
*   Editor: When performing incremental build (Android, Windows, OSX, WebGL, iOS), player assemblies will be placed now in Library/Bee folder rather than Library folder, and will persist until the next build.
    
*   Graphics: DX12 doesn't revert to worse texture detail anymore, when the GPU memory is running out.
    
*   Graphics: Mark OpenGL ES 2.0 as deprecated in Graphics API selection UI.
    
*   IL2CPP: Code generation option moved from build settings (EditorUserBuildSettings.il2CppCodeGeneration  
    ) to player settings (PlayerSettings.SetIl2CppCodeGeneration/PlayerSettings.GetIl2CppCodeGeneration). This option is now per platform and persisted with the project.
    
*   Input System: When exceptions occur in user code inside of Input System callbacks, the exception message is now printed first and details about the callback second to avoid hiding exception details.
    
*   Package: Com.unity.live-capture 1.0.1 package to com.unity.live-capture 2.0.0-pre.3.

*   Package: Updated Sequences to 1.1.0-pre.1.
    
*   Package: Updated Subsystem Registration package version to 1.1.1.
    
*   Package Manager: Replaced the communication layer between Unity and the Unity Package Manager to connect using IPC instead of HTTP in order to solve a number of connectivity issues.
    
*   Prefabs: Removed disconnected state for Prefab instances.

*   Documentation: Improved Scripting API docs page for RayTracingAccelerationStructure. Added See Also section.
    
*   Editor: (Dynamic Hints) If the target window of a Dynamic Hint is available but unfocused, it becomes focused before the Dynamic Hint is shown.
    
*   Editor: Added a new badge system for scene templates that allows for a visual categorization.

*   Profiler: Added UnityEngine.Object lifecycle tracing to the Unity Profiler.
    
*   Profiler: The command-line argument "-profiler-log-file" now not only sets profiler target file but also activates profiler. (1339129)
    
*   Profiler: Updated com.unity.profiling.core@1.0.0. The package enables advanced markup for Unity Profiler markers and counters. See more details at https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.profiling.core@1.0/manual/index.html.
    
*   Profiler: Updated Profile Analyzer package version to 1.1.1, which includes two bug fixes. Release notes available at https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.performance.profile-analyzer@latest/index.html?subfolder=/changelog/CHANGELOG.html.

*   Search: Improved asset indexer performances and index size. (1343812)
    
*   Services: Added Services top menu for services discovery.
    
*   Shadergraph: Adjusted Blackboard article to clarify multi-select functionality.
    
*   Shadergraph: Changed "Create Node" action in ShaderGraph stack separator context menu to "Add Block Node" and added it to main stack context menu.
    
*   Shadergraph: Only ShaderGraph keywords count towards the shader permutation variant limit, SubGraph keywords do not.
    
*   Shadergraph: ShaderGraph SubGraphs will now report errors and warnings in a condensed single error.
    
*   Terrain: Updated the version of Terrain Tools included the Package Manager to 4.0.3. (Previously 4.0.0-pre.2).
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.6.1.
    
*   uGUI: Removed the HideFlags.HideAndDontSave on the mesh inside Graphics for it to get properly cleaned up on both managed and native side. ([1319556](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-meshes-and-event-system-objects-not-removed-between-instances-of-player))
    
*   uGUI: Updated the context menu order and grouped all non-TMP game objects and components under legacy.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Asset types referenced from USS files are now enforced on a per-property basis and generates warnings instead of errors.

*   URP: Stripping shader variants per renderer features instead of combined renderer features.
    
*   URP: The behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" has changed on mobile. Previously, "Dont Care" would behave identically to "Solid Color" on mobile. Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
    
*   URP: UniversalRendererData and ForwardRendererData GUIDs have been reversed so that users coming from 2019LTS, 2020LTS and 2021.1 have a smooth upgrade path. For 2021.2 Alpha/Beta users, you may encounter issues and are strongly recommended to start with a fresh library if initial upgrade fails.
    
*   URP: URP Asset Inspector - Advanced settings have been reordered under `Show Additional Properties` in each section.
    
*   URP: URP Asset Inspector - `General` section has been renamed to `Rendering`.
    
*   URP: URP will no longer render via an intermediate texture unless actively required by a Renderer Feature. See the upgrade guide for compatibility options and how assets are upgraded.
    
*   URP: VFX: New shadergraph support directly on Universal target.
    
*   URP: When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.
