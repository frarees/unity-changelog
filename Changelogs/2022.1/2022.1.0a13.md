    *   Youngest in front  
        
    *   Oldest in front  
        
    *   By Depth

#### Improvements

*   Audio: Import now supports multiprocess.
    
*   Build Pipeline: On platforms using incremental player builds, data builds will now be skipped if data has not changed, even for non-development builds.
    
*   Core: Job Debugger performance was improved.
    
*   Documentation: Added proper example for PhysicsScene.Simulate.

*   Editor: Normal Map textures now have a new "Flip Green Channel" import setting (useful for textures that were baked in 3dsmax/Unreal/Source/CryEngine convention). All textures got a Swizzle advanced import setting, for arbitrary color channel remapping/flipping.
    
*   Editor: Reduced time to enter playmode.
    
*   GI: Maximum environment sample is 2048, as no quality improvements could be seen beyond that threshold.

*   Scripting: Optimized searching for scripts when the assembly name is not supplied which can significantly improve performance entering PlayMode amongst other areas.
    
*   Serialization: Avoid unnecessary serialization when calling SerializedObject.ApplyModifiedProperties in the single target case.
    
*   XR: Added SRP batcher support for late latching.

*   Android: Toggling Build App Bundle in the Build Player Window will now prompt for a save location rather than attempting to use the last build location which would have been the incorrect type of package. ([1329922](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-building-app-using-ctrl-plus-b-shortcut-uses-the-last-used-configuration-instead-of-the-current-one))

*   Animation: Fixed Animation window property selection from displaying duplicate Components when one Component type derives from another. ([1248925](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadow-property-is-replaced-in-animation-window-property-selection-when-shadow-component-is-below-the-outline-in-the-inspector))
    
*   Animation: Fixed error message spam "BlendTreeWorkspace is NULL" when saving the scene when an animation preview is active. ([1343833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/blendtreeworkspace-is-null-error-spam-while-a-blendtree-state-is-open-in-animator-window-after-saving-scene))

*   Animation: Fixed keyframing of the "Active" property in constraint components. ([1317876](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/warning-message-when-constraint-dot-active-is-added-as-property-in-the-animationclip))
    
*   Animation: Fixed UndoPropertyModification currentValue returning null when changing Material's properties in the Inspector while keyframing. ([1343018](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/undopropertymodification-currentvalue-returns-null-when-changing-materials-properties-in-the-inspector))
    
*   Animation: GameObject is not animated when the Animator Component is enabled during Play Mode and Culling Mode is set to "Cull Completely". ([1263490](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobject-is-not-animated-when-the-animator-component-is-enabled-during-play-mode-and-culling-mode-is-set-to-cull-completely))
    
*   Animation: StateMachine callbacks (OnStateEnter(), OnStateUpdate() and OnStateExit()) where called twice when a playable was bound to an animator with a state machine. They are now called only once, as expected. ([1299849](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onstateenter-and-onstateexit-are-called-multiple-times-when-using-timeline-with-control-track))
    
*   Animation: Updated sort method for animation clips in animation window using alphanum/natural sort. ([1261365](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animation-animation-clip-naming-does-not-follow-ascending-naming-convention))
