### 2022.1.13f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Editor: Added editor analytics event tracking for "Refresh access" and "New link..." button click.

#### Improvements

*   Graphics: 3D: \[com.unity.template.3d\] Defaulting color space to Linear.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Improved TextField performance.
    

#### Fixes

*   Editor: Fixed an issue where certain properties could not be excluded in the TextureImporterInspector. ([UUM-3787](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/preset-some-properties-cannot-be-excluded-from-texture-importer-preset-through-the-inspector-window))
    
*   iOS: Fixed a bug with the "Force iOS Speakers when Recording" player setting. In addition, a few other iOS Bluetooth audio bugs were fixed. When starting up with Bluetooth headphones connected, audio output used to play through the built-in speakers (which was an error). The list of available microphones was not always correct when connecting / dis-connecting Bluetooth headphones at runtime. Bluetooth microphone input was really choppy. ([1387403](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sound-is-playing-through-the-ear-speaker-if-using-force-ios-speakers-when-recording-when-prepare-ios-for-recording-is-on))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed an issue where Application.logMessageReceived can be called from a job, when the job is scheduled on the main thread. ([UUM-3085](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/application-dot-logmessagereceived-is-called-from-worker-thread-when-logging-errors-from-bursted-ijob))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed an issue where define constraints on unity's pre-defined symbols like "UNITY\_INCLUDE\_TESTS" were misbehaving for Precompiled assemblies. ([UUM-9378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-dll-file-is-included-in-the-build-when-the-only-reference-to-it-is-enclosed-in-number-if-unity-editor))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Improved UI Builder performance when adding a visual element to a project. (UUM-5126)
    
*   URP: Fixed Gizmos in Game View when using Viewports (UUM-7069).
    
*   WebGL: Fixed bug where the rendering canvas wasn't resizing when changing orientation. ([UUM-1135](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mobile-web-half-of-screen-is-not-rendered-on-mobile-when-screen-orientation-is-landscape))
    
*   Windows: Fixed builds launching on the wrong display after upgrading the project from Unity 2020.3. If the project was previously upgraded to 2021.3, this may cause the builds to start up on a different display first. Use Win + Shift + Left/Right arrow to move the window to the desired display. (UUM-4178)
    
*   Windows: Fixed resolution misdetection on vertical displays, which caused APIs like Screen.currentResolution or Screen.GetDisplayLayout() return wrong data and the player contain letterboxing when it shouldn't. ([UUM-7552](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-player-does-not-refresh-window-display-properties-when-opening-the-player-on-another-display))
    
*   Windows: Restore the display enumeration behaviour of Unity 2021.1 and earlier: the primary display will always be treated as display 1.
