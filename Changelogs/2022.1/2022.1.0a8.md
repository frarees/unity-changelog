    *   Renamed preference "Update Units Automatically" to "Update Nodes Automatically".
*   Package Manager: Changed error and warning box to look like the info box.

*   Android: Il2cpp resources will be extracted during player launch only when needed, for ex., changes in scripts. Previously they would be extracted each time you make a new build from Unity.

*   Asset Pipeline: Calling CreateAsset twice on the same location with the same asset didn't update ProjectBrowser. ([1345123](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asset-gets-treated-as-a-root-folder-after-creating-a-sprite-asset-from-the-same-texture-multiple-times))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Calling CreateAsset with a path that is an existing folder now generates an error. ([1344954](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assetdatabase-dot-createasset-overwites-folder-without-a-warning))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an infinite import loop that could occur on case-sensitive file systems if similarly named meta files were encountered. ([1345905](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-is-stuck-on-loading-scripting-assemblies-when-there-is-a-meta-file-of-non-existent-asset-and-asset-database-v2-is-used))

*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where it was possible invalid and unusable Presets without any errors. The Preset constructor now throws an exception when doing so. ([1348271](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/creating-a-preset-of-an-asset-type-marked-as-excluded-from-presets-is-allowed-but-the-generated-preset-is-not-usable))

*   Audio: For complex send-receive configurations branching the signals between two mixer groups an order-dependent buffering delay was introduced that caused flange-like effects. The correct evaluation order of all effects is now enforced to prevent this. ([1309970](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-gets-distorted-after-reordering-the-audio-groups-inside-an-audio-mixer))
    
*   Audio: Increased stack size of audio streaming and async threads to avoid overflows when using managed read callbacks. ([1352803](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/stack-overflow-exceptions-is-thrown-when-using-system-dot-io-dot-monoio-dot-seek-and-assetbundle-dot-loadfromstreamasync))
    
*   Build Pipeline: The build subtarget is now adjusted to kStandaloneBuildSubtargetServer when BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer is called with the deprecated option BuildOptions.EnableHeadlessMode set to true so the scripted build pipeline remains backward compatible until the option is effectively removed. ([1354146](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/deprecated-buildoptions-dot-enableheadlessmode-needs-clearer-warning-for-its-conflicts-with-buildoptions-dot-subtarget-field))
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where Debug.LogError logs from Bursted code would be treated as compiler errors.
