### 2022.1.1f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

*   Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.3.2 version.
    
*   Burst: Removed the requirement that `BurstLoader` has to initialize `BurstReflection` during a domain reload, making `BurstLoader` setup 2x faster during domain reloads.
    
*   Graphics: Using memoryless MSAA now also applies to the MSAA attachment when depth resolve is used.
    
*   Mono: Added support for direct ETW profiler integration on Windows Desktop for managed code, with no plugin required.
    

#### API Changes

*   iOS: Added: Added iPad Air 5 and iPhone SE 3 to devices.

#### Changes

*   Burst: Made Burst explicitly check for any compilation requests that came from `AssemblyBuilder`, and do not compile these with Burst. These exist outside the normal compilation pipeline, and Burst could not support them (but we now explicitly check for that case).
    
*   Burst: Made Burst's ILPP 22% faster by caching dependent assemblies that the being-processed assembly uses.
    
*   Core: NativeArray and NativeSlice Length is no longer reset when an instance is disposed, so as to ensure entry into iterators that would likely yield a disposed object exception.
    
*   iOS: Changed how selection is handled if it's set before the on screen keyboard has showed up.
    
*   Services: UGS packages are now available in the Package Manager.
    

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed 'require texture compression' setting being reset during player build. ([1397965](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-size-increased-on-first-build-when-compress-textures-slash-assets-on-import-is-enabled))
    
*   2D: Fixed issue where Sprite reference might be lost after upgrading. ([1398401](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-references-are-missing-in-the-sprite-renderer-when-importing-sprite-sheets-created-in-earlier-versions-of-the-editor))
    
*   AI: Fixed unidirectional NavMesh links creating erroneous connection between polygons. ([1328727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unidirectional-navmeshlink-results-in-navmeshagents-pathing-incorrectly))
    
*   Android: Added Initial launch size metadata into AndroidManifest.xml for Chrome OS devices with Android R or higher installed. (1360064)
    
*   Android: Fixed a bug with Unity UGUI and UI Elements input fields, where switching languages dynamically and IME functionality was not working. ([1395812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-bluetooth-keyboard-can-only-type-in-english-when-keyboard-language-is-changed-to-any-other-language))
    
*   Android: Fixed a Unity Audio bug related to Bluetooth audio. This was causing issues with Vivox, and possibly other 3rd part audio libraries, with Bluetooth functionality. On Android, Bluetooth audio state is basically global, so Unity Audio now only makes the bare minimum changes to this state. We may still call startBluetoothSco and stopBluetoothSco when starting or re-initializing the audio output engine and when starting/stopping the Unity microphone. We may also call AudioManager.setMode when starting/stopping a Bluetooth mic through the Unity microphone APIs, but that's it. (1418634)
    
*   Android: Fixed XR subsystem initialization in case of app bundle + asset packs. ([1392895](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-xr-tracking-is-not-working-when-building-app-bundle-with-split-application-binary-enabled))
    
*   Animation: Fixed an issue where the parameter preview of the animator did not work anymore. ([1388833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-blendtree-parameters-slider-value-is-stuck-at-0-when-trying-to-move-the-slider))
    
*   Asset Bundles: Ensure that padding is added after blocks info so that Switch patching works appropriately. This fix implies that loading newly generated AssetBundles will require using this new Unity editor/runtime combination. ([1403996](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/files-within-assetbundles-do-not-start-on-aligned-boundaries-breaking-patching-on-nintendo-switch))
    
*   Asset Import: Upgraded boost::asio version to v1.20.0. (1408567)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed issue with assert during accelerator client corruption detection. (1376291)
    
*   Build System: Dedicated server build will not inadvertently strip mesh data from meshes used for collision. ([1399961](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dedicated-server-data-from-mesh-colliders-are-stripped-in-dedicated-server-builds))
    
*   Build System: Removed legacy project file causing issues when opened through VSCode's Omnisharp. (1389396)
    
*   Burst: A potential issue with the debug info mover pass, that meant it only affected the first entry point in a module.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug when calling profiling `CreateMarker` on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find `CreateMarker__Unmanaged`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where if you had synchronous compilation on a job, disabled Burst compilation and entered playmode, then exited playmode, and finally re-enabled Burst compilation, a hang could occur.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where if you used `FloatMode.Fast` with `math.pow`, where the `y` argument to `math.pow` was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to `powf` from the cstdlib).
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where toggling Burst enable <-> disable during a playmode execution using Burst, and then attaching the managed debugger, could cause an editor crash.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where using `ReinterpretStore(someIndex, (ushort)someValue)` could cause an internal compiler error in Burst.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a memory leak where during hashing we'd pin a GC object and never unpin and free it.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a potential deadlock whereby if Burst was compiling in the background (the background tasks window showed Burst in it) and a user switched from release to debug in the editor, Burst could cause a deadlock.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a super rare bug where Burst could hit an internal error with `System.InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value`.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a super rare hashing bug in Burst whereby it was possible that the Burst Hash Cache for a given assembly was out of sync with the Assembly Loader cache.
    
*   Burst: Fixed another rare case of the file-is-locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb.
    
*   Burst: Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters.
    
*   Burst: Fixed hashing error that could occur with unbound generic type.
    
*   Burst: Inspector font style changing when entering and exiting play mode.
    
*   Burst: Right pane vertical scrollbar not always showing correctly.
    
*   Core: Removed disposed NativeArray and NativeSlice check when iterating or accessing properties like Length due to a performance regression when collections checks are enabled.
    
*   Documentation: Fixed misleading information for ModifiableContactPair.SetPoint().
    
*   DX12: - Offset binding support for cbuffers disabled from SystemInfo on DX12 as it has never been supported, full implementation is upcoming. ([1381731](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/painting-terrain-details-result-in-a-crash-when-using-directx12))
    
*   Editor: Backport bug fix from 2022.2: Executing Build And Run with Dedicated Server platform now opens terminal window on Linux and macOS. ([1354166](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-executing-build-and-run-with-dedicated-server-platform-does-not-open-terminal))
    
*   Editor: Fixed default label width in material inspectors. ([1405121](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/property-fields-have-become-narrower-when-using-materialeditor-dot-setdefaultguiwidths))
    
*   Editor: Fixed for pen in the new input system on Windows so that displayIndex is set and button flags are more consistent. (1395895)
    
*   Editor: Fixed incorrect screen size when dragging in the prefab stage. ([1394756](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-is-glitchy-when-editing-in-prefab-mode-in-a-custom-ui-environment))
    
*   Editor: Fixed rendering on overlay cameras in 2d with no post-processing. ([1387283](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-2d-game-view-displays-a-blank-screen-when-overlay-camera-is-present))
    
*   Editor: Fixed tooltips not being resolved when using a custom label that does not contain a tooltip. ([1415921](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tooltips-are-not-shown-when-hovering-over-name-of-the-value-in-the-inspector))
    
*   Graphics: Crash when calling Graphics.RenderMesh for a Mesh that was destroyed.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed mipmap streaming issue that could happen in projects where Quality Setting "Texture Quality" specifies a texture mipmap level of lower resolution that the one set in Quality Setting "Texture Streaming / Max Level Reduction" (case 1417479). (1410879)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed redundant store of depth buffer MSAA samples to memory on Quest when depth resolve is used. (1413086)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed reinitializing of a compressed, non-crunched texture. ([1401977](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture2d-dot-reinitialize-throws-error-when-resizing-with-a-compressed-textureformat))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed wrong RT discarding on metal when using CommandBuffers in OnRenderImage. ([1395106](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-next-camera-is-prevented-from-rendering-in-stack-when-precommand-buffer-is-used-for-post-processing-in-main-camera))
    
*   Graphics: Universal backport added missing shader keyword for shader graph when rendering with deferred rendering. ([1372326](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dark-band-on-the-scene-objects-when-using-deferred-rendering-and-custom-shader-made-with-shader-graph))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed a leak when creating and destroying manually reflection probes. ([1394192](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-memory-leak-when-destroying-reflection-probes))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed an issue with overlay queued shaders not rendering in HDRP (case 1400281). ([1379399](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-meshes-with-overlay-render-queue-tag-are-not-rendered))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed decal normal overwriting normal map when normal blending is enabled. (1400660)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed prefab mode context visibility not hiding custom passes, decals, and local volumetric fog objects. ([1395948](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/custompass-with-custompassutils-dot-renderfromcamera-is-inconsistent-in-prefab-mode))
