*   URP: Changed the default name when a new urp asset is created.
    
*   URP: Converted internal render targets to use `RTHandle` targets instead of `RenderTargetHandle` and `RenderTargetIdentifier`.
    
*   URP: Improved blending modes trigger a material update which tries to keep the existing look intact. This is not always possible and manual blend mode changes might be required.
    
*   URP: Main light shadow, additional light shadow and additional light keywords are now enabled based on urp setting instead of existence in scene. This allows better variant stripping.
    
*   URP: MaterialReimporter.ReimportAllMaterials now batches the asset database changes to improve performance.
    
*   URP: Multiply blend now keeps DstAlpha as it's RGB only.
    
*   URP: Now using the SpeedTree8 PBRLit shadergraph as the default SpeedTree8 shader for Universal.
    
*   URP: Particle AlphaModulate() renamed to AlphaModulateAndPremultiply() as it does both. Moved separate AlphaModulate() and AlphaPremultiply() to URP shader library. Fix double alpha multiply for ParticleLit.
    
*   URP: Refactored some of the array resizing code around decal projector rendering to use the new APIs in render core.
    
*   URP: Removed experimental tile deferred code.
    
*   URP: Removed the name input for the SSAO and Screen Space Shadows renderer features.
    
*   URP: Removed use of deprecated UNITY\_USE\_NATIVE\_HDR keyword in shaders.
    
*   URP: Separated Premultiplied blend mode and Preserve Specular Lighting feature from each other. Premultiplied blend mode is now true straight premultiply mode. Preserve Specular Lighting, which applies alpha differently for diffuse and specular parts of lighting, is now a separate option for Alpha and Additive blend modes. The results of previous Premultiplied blend implementation can be achieved by using Alpha blend mode with Preserve Specular Lighting toggled on.
    
*   URP: Set usage of `RenderTargetHandle` and public functions using `RenderTargetIdentifier` as obsolete for future removal.
    
*   URP: Split RendererFeatures `AddRenderPasses` into two functions with `SetupRenderPasses` so render targets can be used after allocation.
    
*   URP: Stripping shader variants per renderer features instead of combined renderer features.
    
*   URP: The behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" has changed on mobile. Previously, "Dont Care" would behave identically to "Solid Color" on mobile. Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
    
*   URP: UniversalRendererData and ForwardRendererData GUIDs have been reversed so that users coming from 2019LTS, 2020LTS and 2021.1 have a smooth upgrade path. For 2021.2 Alpha/Beta users, you may encounter issues and are strongly recommended to start with a fresh library if initial upgrade fails.
    
*   URP: URP Asset Inspector - Advanced settings have been reordered under `Show Additional Properties` in each section.
    
*   URP: URP Asset Inspector - `General` section has been renamed to `Rendering`.
    
*   URP: URP will no longer render via an intermediate texture unless actively required by a Renderer Feature. See the upgrade guide for compatibility options and how assets are upgraded.
    
*   URP: VFX: New shadergraph support directly on Universal target.
    
*   URP: When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.
