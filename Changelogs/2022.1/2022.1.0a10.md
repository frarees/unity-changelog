Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
    
*   URP: When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.

*   AI: Fixed crashes from building the NavMesh from meshes without valid vertex data. ([1315584](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-rasterizetri-when-static-batching-passes-invalid-mesh-data-into-the-navmesh-build-process))
    
*   AI: Fixed how the NavMesh is computed in some situations where multiple ledges in the environment form a steep slope (e.g. computing NavMesh on a narrow stair which has hand rails). ([1074084](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-small-gap-is-created-in-the-default-navmesh-when-setting-step-height-from-0-dot-76-to-1-dot-08-and-baking-navmesh))
    
*   Android: Compass.headingAccuracy will report one of predefined values giving some indication on accuracy. ([1304067](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-input-dot-compass-dot-headingaccuracy-is-always-set-to-0))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue where AMD drivers on Chrome OS have a faulty EGL\_KHR\_gl\_colorspace implementation, sRGB will be disabled in that case. (1359181)
    
*   Android: Fixed baking reflectionprobes with Vulkan Editor and build target Android. ([1344866](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/image-invalid-format-error-is-thrown-when-generating-lights-on-vulkan-graphics-api-and-android-build-target))

*   Android: Further improved build times when a sequential build is done with no changes in project. Previously Unity was moving apk/aab from gradle project to final location, thus forcing the gradle to rebuild apk/aab on sequential builds. Unity will perform a copy instead now. Our tests show that sequential build times improved by 50% (ie. dropping from 12 seconds to 5 seconds). (1361602)
    
*   Android: Gradle template placeholder DIR\_UNITYPROJECT works again. ([1346794](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-template-variable-star-star-dir-unityproject-star-star-is-not-properly-substituted-when-exporting-a-gradle-project))
    
*   Android: Il2cpp resources will be extracted during player launch only when needed, for ex., changes in scripts. Previously they would be extracted each time you make a new build from Unity.
    
*   Android: In the new input system, the search, call, endcall, camera, focus, and headsethook keys were all mapped to various function keys. These mappings are not helpful on any current platforms, and in the case of the search key, this mapping is wrong on Chrome OS keyboards which have separate search and F2 keys. (1343608)
    
*   Android: Stylus input is now treated as a touch rather than mouse in the older input system. ([1246579](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/samsung-s-pen-touches-are-not-registered-when-samsung-s-pen-is-used-to-touch-screen))
    
*   Android: Toggling Build App Bundle in the Build Player Window will now prompt for a save location rather than attempting to use the last build location which would have been the incorrect type of package. ([1329922](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-building-app-using-ctrl-plus-b-shortcut-uses-the-last-used-configuration-instead-of-the-current-one))

*   Animation: Fixed Animation window property selection from displaying duplicate Components when one Component type derives from another. ([1248925](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadow-property-is-replaced-in-animation-window-property-selection-when-shadow-component-is-below-the-outline-in-the-inspector))

*   Asset Pipeline: Blender and Maya files now import at the correct scale. ([1320649](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/model-file-to-unity-scaling-is-defined-as-1m-file-to-100m-unity-when-importing-blend-file))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Call to AssetDatabase.ForceReserializeAssets() throws exception, if being called from callback, while scene is also being modified. It is recommended to call AssetDatabase.ForceReserializeAssets() from menu item style entry point. ([1089842](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assetdatabase-dot-forcereserializeassets-breaks-the-scene-when-used-in-onenable))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Calling CreateAsset twice on the same location with the same asset didn't update ProjectBrowser. ([1345123](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asset-gets-treated-as-a-root-folder-after-creating-a-sprite-asset-from-the-same-texture-multiple-times))

*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where Importer/Rig Update button does not update. ([1324031](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/importer-slash-rig-update-button-does-not-update))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where it was possible invalid and unusable Presets without any errors. The Preset constructor now throws an exception when doing so. ([1348271](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/creating-a-preset-of-an-asset-type-marked-as-excluded-from-presets-is-allowed-but-the-generated-preset-is-not-usable))

*   Asset Pipeline: When asset object is reloaded, it is now reset before loaded with new values. This fixes a problem with fields with default values not being set to default value, if field was removed from assets. (1337405)
    
*   Audio: Fixed calculation of channel audibility such that a signal which is branched off via send/receive effects in a mixer group and fully attenuated after the branching correctly retain the audibility contributed by the send-receive connection.
