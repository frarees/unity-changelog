### Known Issues in 2018.4.30f1

*   Audio: Crash on AudioSource::Stop when exiting Play mode ([1079263](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-audiosource-stop-when-exiting-play-mode))
    
*   Linux: Focus cannot be properly gained on play mode, making keyboard input switch screens ([1109908](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-focus-cannot-be-properly-gained-on-play-mode-making-keyboard-input-switch-screens))
    
*   Package Manager: Immutable packages altered by the API Updater are reverted to their original state when packages are resolved, which can lead to slower import performance in that context.
    
*   macOS: If the Android Tools are not installed through the Hub, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) default security settings will prevent the Android NDK binaries being executed. These settings have to be changed or a signed Android NDK (r16b) will be needed to build Android. More information here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older\_releases.
    

### 2018.4.30f1 Release Notes

#### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed math expressions evaluate when the first digit is entered after the operator in Sprite Frame Module inspector of Sprite Editor Window. ([1250883](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/math-expressions-evaluate-when-the-first-digit-is-entered-after-the-operator))
    
*   AI: Corrected the stray NavMeshAgent to always move to the closest NavMesh instead of somewhere above or below. ([1072945](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/a-navmeshagent-gameobject-teleports-to-a-near-navmeshsurface-when-collided-with-a-moving-navmeshobstacle))
    
*   Android: Fixed to switch internal Unity allocator to DynamicHeapAllocator which is compatible with Scudo allocator introduced in Android 11. This fixes an error "Using memoryadresses from more than 16GB of memory". If by some reason you want to revert to previous allocator, pass "-systemallocator" command line argument in UnityPlayerActivity updateUnityCommandLineArguments. ([1284525](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-il2cpp-empty-project-crashes-on-launch-with-using-memoryadresses-from-more-than-16gb-of-memory-messages))
    
*   Asset Bundles: Fixed AssetBundle related race condition that would occasionally crash when calling AssetBundle.Unload while an async load operation out of that AssetBundle was in progress. ([1228306](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/getpreloaddata-crash-when-loading-asset-bundles))
    
*   Audio: Fixed to synchronize audio source playing state with timeline clip playing state. ([1146694](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audiosource-dot-isplaying-is-set-to-false-when-audio-is-being-played-through-a-playable-director))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed an issue where asset bundle dependencies might not have been deterministic. ([1282671](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/order-of-asset-bundle-setup-affects-the-contents-of-the-asset-bundles-that-depend-on-them))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed targetTexture rendering black screen when changing it in OnPreRender(). ([1274376](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-onpostrender-post-process-is-not-rendered-if-anti-aliasing-is-enabled))
    
*   Kernel: Improved memory management for storing object information. ([1275751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/allocated-memory-is-not-cleared-when-loading-and-unloading-scenes))
    
*   macOS: Fixed Mac editor/player hanging the whole OS on Apple silicon devices. ([1285304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-dtk-unity-screen-freeze))
    
*   Profiler: Fixed such that scroll wheel will now work on the scroll bars in the profiler timeline view. ([1280335](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-timeline-view-scroll-bars-are-not-interactive-when-the-mouse-cursor-is-in-the-scroll-bar-field))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed issue where thread statics that reused thread static slots would not adhere to type alignment. This would cause the garbage collector to incorrectly clean up thread static data because it would only scan pointer aligned memory for references. This would lead to memory becoming corrupted and inducing random crashes. ([1266322](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mono-class-fill-runtime-generic-context-when-entering-play-mode-repeatedly))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed random crash on OSX due to thread\_get\_state failure. (1268952)
    
*   Text: Fixed IME getting permanently disabled on focus and / or context change. ([1091254](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/korean-symbols-can-not-be-typed-into-gui-dot-textarea-korean-ime-is-disabled))
    
*   Video: Fixed to use 2d spatial blending when playing audio in direct mode. ([1276611](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/videoplayer-plays-sound-in-mono-when-audio-output-mode-is-set-to-direct-and-the-video-playing-has-2-channels))
    
*   XR: Fixed Hololens 2 apps pausing when carry along apps are open.
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed SecurityException being thrown in build when using Humanizer plugin. ([1271060](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-securityexception-is-thrown-in-build-when-using-humanizer-plugin))
    

#### Improvements

*   Android: Changed such that in the case of incomplete application install, where native libraries are missing, a dialog will now be shown where app can be gracefully quit. Previous behavior was an application crash in com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer.<clinit>, java.lang.System.loadLibrary functions. (1281533)
    
*   IL2CPP: Improved error message when required Visual Studio components are not installed when building for Windows.
