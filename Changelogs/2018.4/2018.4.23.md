-   OpenGL: Crash on BufferManagerGLES::AcquireBuffer when in Play Mode ([1230566](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/opengl-crash-on-buffermanagergles-acquirebuffer-when-in-play-mode))

-   Package Manager: Immutable packages altered by the API Updater are reverted to their original state when packages are resolved, which can lead to slower import performance in that context.

-   Scene Management: Prefab Variant Transform fileId changes ([1238280](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-variant-transform-fileid-changes))

-   Shuriken: Crash on CreateDirect3D11SurfaceFromDXGISurface when calling DrawRenderer with a Trail Renderer ([1216216](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-createdirect3d11surfacefromdxgisurface-when-calling-drawrenderer-with-a-trail-renderer))

-   macOS: If the Android Tools are not installed through the Hub, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) default security settings will prevent the Android NDK binaries being executed. These settings have to be changed or a signed Android NDK (r16b) will be needed to build Android. More information here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.
