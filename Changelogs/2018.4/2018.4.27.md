-   MacOS: \[Mac\] Many artifacts can be seen in Scene View when Scene Light is enabled and HDR is on with Metal API and Mac OS X 10.15.4 ([1240265](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-many-artifacts-can-be-seen-in-scene-view-when-scene-light-is-enabled-on-with-metal-api-and-mac-os-x-10-dot-15-dot-4))
