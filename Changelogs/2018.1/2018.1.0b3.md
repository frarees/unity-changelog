*   Editor: Added `InspectorWindow.OnPostHeaderGUI` callback to allow drawing of custom GUI elements in the inspector window.
*   Editor: Plug-in code that creates textures used in rendering with IMGUI should now avoid specifying them in linear space (i.e. should set the linear parameter to false in the `Texture2D` constructor). Otherwise, GUI elements drawn with such textures may look washed out when the project is working in Linear space (Player Settings > Color space: Linear).
*   Editor: Removed "intensity" float field next to HDR texture fields in material editors; instead use the exposure controls in the Color Picker.

*   Shaders: Added Windows support for shader include absolute paths longer than 260 characters.
*   Shaders: Compute shaders are now included in the shader cache. E.g. tweaking a shader and then reverting the change will fetch the shader from the cache instead of recompilation.
*   Shaders: Global shader properties are now visible to compute shaders. A global property value will be used if the property is not set locally for the compute shader.
*   Shaders: Proper shader include dependency tracking implemented. Whenever a shader include file is modified all the dependent shaders - and nothing else - will get reimported.
*   Shaders: Shader compilation speed improvement.
*   Shaders: Surface Shaders with many multi\_compile/shader\_feature variants import several times faster now (internally that step has been multithreaded).
*   Shaders: `ComputeShader.Dispatch` now validates if all the properties are valid.
*   Shaders: `SetPropertyBlock` can now be used per material (in case of multi-material renderer), and can now use an optional material index.

*   Windows: Multiple improvements in crash handling:
    *   Unity applications that enable the Performance Reporting Service will now receive Windows crash telemetry.
    *   Crash interception is now much more reliable, catching more categories of error, sooner and later in the application life.
    *   The crash UX for the player has been updated to remove the wordy English-only error message and display something generic before handing off to WER (which tells the user what happened in their native language).
*   XR: Metal: Implemented the remaining draw call functionality (`Graphics.DrawProcedural` etc) for Single-Pass Stereo rendering, which was missing previously.
