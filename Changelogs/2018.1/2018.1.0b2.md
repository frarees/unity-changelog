*   Build Pipeline: Android Build & Run has now target device selection in the build dialog. It allows users to deploy to either a specific single device or to all supported devices simultaneously.
    
*   Cache Server: Added `-CacheServerIPAddress` command line argument to connect Editor to specified Cache Server on startup.
    
*   Editor: New ObjectFactory API that allow to create Object using default values - See ScriptingAPI and Presets for more details.

*   Scripting: Added command line option "overrideMonoSearchPath" for desktop standalone players (OSX, Windows). "overrideMonoSearchPath" specifies an extra folder to search when Mono is loading assemblies. One intended use is two versions of the same project i.e. trial and full version. The assets are the same but the scripts are different. This command line option can be used to re-use the assets but load different scripts.

*   XR: 360 stereo image capture with support for conversion of rendered texture (cubemap) to stereo/mono equirectangular format for display in VR. Added script API: `RenderTexture.ConvertToEquirect()` for converting rendered cubemap textures to stereo and mono equirectangular format.
    
*   XR: Added a new option in the Windows MR Player Settings called **Enable Depth Buffer Sharing**. This allows the OS to better stabilize images without the need to manually set the focus plane. For more information on the benefits of image stabilization, see Microsoft's documentation on [Hologram Stability](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/hologram_stability).
    
*   XR: Added support for capturing stereoscopic 360 images for VR and non-VR projects. Added omni-directional stereo (ODS) support in shader pipeline for rendering to 360 stereo cubemap.
    
    *   Support for 360 stereo cubemap rendering in forward/deferred pipelines, directional/point light shadows, Skybox, MSAA, HDR and post processing stack. All pipelines and modes are tested.
    *   ODS rendering support for screenspace shadows via separate ods world space pass and render texture to avoid incorrect shadows per eye.
    *   Added stereo `RenderToCubemap` API script support: `camera.RenderToCubemap` with stereo eye parameter.
*   XR: Standalone player support for stereoscopic 360 image capture for VR and non-VR projects. Currently supported on Win64/OSX platforms.
    
    *   Generate 360 capture shader variants when building standalone player according to the '360 Stereo Capture' UI checkbox in the VR editor settings panel.

Otherwise, GUI elements drawn with such textures may look washed out when the project is working in Linear space (Player Settings > Color space: Linear). (908904)
    
*   Editor: Removed "intensity" float field next to HDR texture fields in material editors; instead use the exposure controls in the Color Picker.

*   OSX: Metal is now the default graphics backend for editor.
    
*   Services: Replaced web-based Collab history window with improved RMGUI version.
    
*   Substance: Built-in support for Substance Designer materials is deprecated in Unity 2017.3, and will be removed in 2018.1. To continue using Substance Designer materials in Unity 2018.1, you will need to install a suitable third-party external importer from the Asset Store.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Build & Run now defaults to 64-bit player when run on local machine.
    
*   Web: AssetBundle related parts of UnityWebRequest have been split into a new module, allowing UnityWebRequest to be used without pulling in AssetBundle module. API change: `UnityWebRequest.GetAssetBundle` -> `UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle`.
    
*   Windows: Removed support for Windows XP in Standalone Player builds. Windows Vista is the minimum supported OS now.

    *   `SHADER_REQUIRE_XYZ` and `SHADER_AVAILABLE_XYZ` preprocessor defines are passed to shaders, based on which features are requested or are available.
*   Shaders: Added Windows support for shader include absolute paths longer than 260 characters.
    
*   Shaders: Compute shaders are now included in the shader cache. E.g. tweaking a shader and then reverting the change will fetch the shader from the cache instead of recompilation.
    
*   Shaders: Global shader properties are now visible to compute shaders. A global property value will be used if the property is not set locally for the compute shader.
    
*   Shaders: Proper shader include dependency tracking implemented. Whenever a shader include file is modified all the dependent shaders - and nothing else - will get reimported. (646064, 916386, 957024)
    
*   Shaders: Shader compilation speed improvement.

*   Universal Windows Platform: Improved support for building project into longer paths.
    
*   Video: Added basic video bitrate control in MediaEncoder API.
