### 2019.1.9f1 Release Notes

#### System Requirements Changes

Nothing changed.

#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   Asset Import: Added a warning when multiple sub-assets are imported with the same name/type. This often happen in the ModelImporter when multiple meshes or material have the same name in the .fbx file. Their resulting fileID (and thus references to them) may break/change if a new sub-asset witht he same name is found before the existing one after a re-import.
