#### Improvements

*   Android: Add keystores dedicated location option

*   Android: Adjust the number of worker threads dynamically according to the number of online cores.
    
*   Android: After building the apk, the Proguard mapping file is placed at the same location
    
*   Android: Check Vulkan device compatibility on Build & Run
    
*   Android: Disable various Adreno Vulkan driver workarounds for latest drivers
    
*   Android: Enumerate all Android audio input device options, including the lowest-latency option, which can be selected via the name "Android voice recognition input".
    
*   Android: Improved il2cpp player startup by ~200ms for second and later launches
    
*   Android: Native Systrace profiling support is implemented
    
*   Android: The Unity video player can now be used with the Vulkan renderer.
    
*   Android: Use OpenSL instead of AudioTrack on more devices. This reduces audio input and output latency.

NOTE: Performance improvements to the underlying mesh optimization code may cause vertices to be generated in a different order than in previous Unity versions. If you rely on vertex ordering in the optimized mesh data such as for vertex painting be aware this data may need to be re-generated.

This means that after the refresh/import scriptables objects will have the modified values from modified assets. Before this change, the scriptable object would get "null" value (when using operator==) after the refresh/import.
