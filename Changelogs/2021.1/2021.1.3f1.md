*   DX12: Fixed black screen that would show when using a non-native resolution in fullscreen. ([1318666](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dx12-nothing-is-being-rendered-when-using-alt-plus-enter-to-maximize-a-resized-windowed-player))

([1288995](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-texture-is-not-displayed-in-texture-selector-preview-icon-when-texture-type-is-2d-array-and-3d))
    
*   Editor: Fixed Texture3DPreview InfoString incorrectly displaying: Texture dimensions as Z-Y-Z instead of X-Y-Z & very small resolutions. (1321095)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed DrawProcedural reporting incorrect triangle counts to FrameStats.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed performance issue when loading textures direct to GPU memory from LZ4 compressed packages. (1307820)

*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which could sometimes lead to missing files in successfully resolved packages in projects with a large number of packaged assets.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which prevented starting `UnityPackageManager.exe` on Windows when its path contained non-ANSI Unicode characters. ([1317244](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-wont-start-with-unicode-install-path))

*   XR: Fixed depth buffer sharing support. ([1242142](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shared-depth-buffer-not-populated-properly-breaking-wmr-reprojection))
    
*   XR: \[Lumin\] : Fixed some improper temp string usage that was causing the allocator to spam the system logs. (1284830)
