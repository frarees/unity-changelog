*   Profiler: Removing the Loading.IDRemapping profiler tag which was causing excessive profiling overhead when loading AssetBundles.
    
*   Profiler: Selections CPU or GPU samples made in the CPU Usage and GPU Usage Profiler Modules now carry over correctly and persistently to all views (Timeline, Hierarchy, Raw Hierarchy) as well as to all frames that contain them. In frames other than the one the selection was originally made in, the selection will point to the first sample that provides the best match to the stack of sample names that lead up to that original sample. So if there are e.g. multiple Components of the same type "MyComponent", and you select the "MyComponent.Update()" sample of one of them, there is no way for the Profiler to identify the "MyComponent.Update()" sample of exactly that sample Component in the next frame. It will therefore just select the very first "MyComponent.Update()" sample it can find. If a part of the Sample Stack is missing in a frame, the selection Tooltip in Timeline or an extra line at the bottom of the Hierarchy views will alert you of the fact, that the selection that was carried over to this frame is just an approximation. An option was added to show the difference in this approximated Sample Stack, and the originally selected Sample Stack. If not even one of the sample names from the original selection fits the samples in a particular frame and thread, no selection will be displayed. If a selection was made on a thread other than the Main Thread, switching to the Hierarchy Views will automatically switch them to the right thread this selection was made in.

#### Changes

*   2D: Updated com.unity.2d.sprite package license.
    
*   2D: Updated com.unity.2d.tilemap package license.
    
*   Android: Removed use of QualitySettings.vSyncCount for Android.
    
*   Android: Updated Android Logcat package to 1.2.0.
    
*   Android: Vulkan is no longer preferred over OpenGL ES when using Android 7 and for all Mali Midgard GPUs.
    
*   Asset Import: Changed Alembic verified package to 2.1.1-pre.1.
    
*   Asset Import: When Meshes have no material defined in the imported file, the ModelImporter will now assign the default material to them rather than creating a 'No name' material sub-asset.
    
*   Burst: Burst enters RC phase.
    
*   Burst: Bursted DOTS Runtime Jobs are now decorated with `[NativePInvokeCallback]` instead of `[MonoPInvokeCallback]` which could generate callback wrappers which could cause native code to inadvertently interop with the managed VM.
    
*   Burst: Changed how exceptions throw types and messages are stored in our Burst binaries to reduce binary size.
    
*   Burst: Changed to inliner heuristics to improve build time and reduce executable size.
    
*   Burst: DOTS Runtime shares the logging code path with the general case.
    
*   Burst: Eager-compilation is now cancelled when script compilation starts, to prevent spurious errors related to recompiled assemblies.
    
*   Burst: Exception strings no longer contain the entry-point name of the job/function-pointer that caused the throw. This change was required because the Burst compiler has to produce deterministic results from any given compile, which is fundamentally opposed to per-entry-point function derivations.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst initialization time.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst Inspector loading time.
    
*   Burst: Improved eager-compilation performance.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of "eager-compilation" (scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed) by cancelling queued eager-compilation when entering play mode with Synchronous Compilation unchecked.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of eager-compilation by not eager-compiling test assemblies.
    
*   Burst: In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, changing the following options in the Burst menu now requires the Editor to be restarted: Enable Compilation, Safety Checks, and Native Debug Mode Compilation. In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, previously-compiled methods will not be recompiled after changing those options, which could lead to undefined behavior where methods may or may not be compiled with the correct options. This change removes that possibility.
    
*   Burst: Made the compiler better at constant-folding complex static readonly constructors.
    
*   Burst: Open-generic static methods are not supported by Burst, but they were previously visible in Burst InspectorBurst: they are now hidden.
    
*   Burst: Temporarily removed the Burst compiler warning about exception throws not in \[Conditional("ENABLE\_UNITY\_COLLECTIONS\_CHECKS")\] methods, to let us address user feedback. The next minor version of Burst will reincorporate this in a more friendly manner.
    
*   Burst: The Burst Inspector no longer uses JIT compilation. The code it shows is now compiled the same way as for editor / player usage.
    
*   Burst: The Burst menu-item `Safety Checks` has been changed to a modal choice of `Off`, `On`, and `Force On`. `Force On` will overwrite any user job or function-pointer with `DisableSafetyChecks = true`. To avoid users falling into the consistent trap of having `Safety Checks` set to `Off`, any reload of the Editor will issue a warning telling the user that `Safety Checks` have been reset to `On`.
    
*   Burst: The command line option `--burst-disable-compilation` is now disabling entirely Burst, including the AppDomain.
    
*   Burst: Updated Cross Compilation Tooling To LLVM 10.
    
*   Burst: Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 11.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.
    
*   Burst: Use platform provided memory intrinsics for iOS, tvOS, WASM, and console platforms.
    
*   Burst: Warnings are hidden in the inspector view.
    
*   Burst: When using "Executable Only" build type on Universal Windows Platform, Burst will now only generate code for a single CPU architecture that you're building for.
    
*   Editor: Deleting an object reference array entry in the Inspector now removes that array element. Previously first deletion set the element reference to none, and the second deletion deleted the element.
    
*   Editor: Deprecated Device Simulator package, feature moved to Core.
    
*   Editor: Quick Search is now part of the Unity Editor and no package needs to be installed.
    
*   Graphics: Avoid unnecessary RenderGraphBuilder.ReadTexture in the "Set Final Target" pass.
    
*   Graphics: Changed Path Tracing's maximum intensity from clamped (0 to 100) to positive value. (1310514)
    
*   Graphics: Changed so texture formats DXT1 and DXT5 in the UI labels are now named "DXT1|BC1" and "DXT5|BC3", indicating terminology used by modern graphics APIs.

*   Graphics: Changed the source value for the ray tracing frame index iterator from m\_FrameCount to the camera frame count. (1301356)
    
*   Graphics: Changed the warning message for ray traced area shadows. (1303410)
    
*   Graphics: ComputeBuffer.IsValid now returns false when compute is not supported and ComputeBuffer.BeginWrite throws InvalidOperationException for invalid ComputeBuffers. ([1259525](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-gles3-crash-on-samsung-galaxy-j5-after-launching-gfx-tests))
    
*   Graphics: Disabled specular occlusion for what we consider medium and larger scale ao > 1.25 with a 25cm falloff interval.
    
*   Graphics: Improved robustness of volumetric sampling in path tracing. (1295187)
    
*   Graphics: Removed backplate from rendering of lighting cubemap as it did not really work conceptually and caused artefacts.
    
*   Graphics: Removed postprocessing package from core packages list.
    
*   Graphics: Removed the material pass probe volumes evaluation mode.
    
*   Graphics: Texture2D.Compress now compressed R8 textures to BC4 and R8G8 textures to BC5, on mobile platforms ETC/EAC are used.
    
*   Graphics: The RTAO's history is now discarded if the occlusion caster was moving. (1303418)
    
*   Graphics: Tidy up of platform abstraction code for shader optimization.
    
*   Graphics: Transparent materials created by the Model Importer are set to not cast shadows.
    
*   Graphics: Unifying the history validation pass so that it is only done once for the whole frame and not per effect.
    
*   Graphics: Updated postprocessing package to 3.1.0.
    
*   Graphics: Updated the tooltip for the Decal Angle Fade property (requires to enable Decal Layers in both HDRP asset and Frame settings). (1308048)
    
*   Graphics: VT-internal warnings no longer show up in the editor window, but still get printed into the editor log file.
    
*   Mobile: Made session bugfixes for Adaptive Performance provider subsystem management.
    
*   Package: Added FBX Exporter package 4.0.0-pre.1 as a core package:

*   Scripting: Changed NativeArray limit of 2GiB in size, and now it can contain 2^31 items instead.
    
*   Scripting: Improved Roslyn analyzers that are inside assembly definition folders so that they apply to the asmdef assembly itself and to other assemblies that reference the asmdef assembly, but not to any other code in the project.
    
*   Scripting: Reintroduced warning that is thrown when a script that is derived from MonoBehaviour has the same name as a built-in component (e.g. Transform).

*   Profiler: Changed call stacks displayed in the selection tool-tip of Timeline view so that they are clickable if they contain file information.
    
*   Profiler: Duplicated sample names in the Call view's tooltip to improve readability. ([1241955](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-gpu-module-hides-call-names-and-total-time-when-the-call-name-doesnt-fit-in-the-given-row))
    
*   Scripting: Added c/cpp/mm/m/java/h as defaults to "Project Settings->Editor->Additional extensions", so they would appear in code editor, and thus providing easy way to edit them and inspect them. (1284679)
    
*   Scripting: Added support for new managed code stripping annotation attributes.
    
*   Scripting: Added support for Unity Version Defines in Assembly definition import options.  
    This feature improvement allows scripts to easily specify different code snippets for different unity version ranges. This is especially useful for introducing calls to newly added public APIs, in which case these API calls needs to be guarded by defines based on a unity version range of a given unity version or later.  
    Unity version range expression syntax is the same as package version range expressions. Unity version format differs from package version format, thus Unity version expressions are evaluated based on some rules specific to the Unity version format:  
    
    *   Comparison of release types follows the following rules: a<b<f=c<p<x. So eg. an alpha version is always smaller (earlier) than a beta version, regardless of the Incremental version.  
        
    *   The unity versions are allowed to have suffixes (e.g 2020.1.3-bonfire) which are ignored by the unity version comparison code  
        
    *   Chinese releases are equivalent to public releases (f) so for the sake of comparison in the version range expression 2020.1f3 would be equal to 2020.1c3\[  
        
    *   experimental releases don't include an Incremental Version - e.g. everything after 2020.2.1x would be treated as suffix and ignored by the version comparison.
*   Scripting: Changed Roslyn Analyzers to be run part of normal Compilation Step.  
    This will also result in Analyzer errors to be treated as an Compile Error.
    
*   Scripting: GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag and GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag are much faster.
    
*   Scripting: MenuItem for manually running script updater is removed. It now always offers to update when it finds a compilation error it can fix.
    
*   Scripting: Performance improvements in ApiUpdater.
    
*   Scripting: Script compilation has a background task progress bar when auto-refresh is disbled.
    
*   Scripting: Script Compilation is now incremental across player builds.
    
*   Scripting: Script Updater approval dialog will show you which files will be overwritten before you give permission.
    
*   Scripting: Script Updater causes fewer script recompiles when importing/upgrading projects.
    
*   Scripting: Scripting: Improved documentation for Application.isPlaying.
    
*   Scripting: The errors that trigger a script updater are no longer displayed in the console window.
    
*   Scripting: UX improved when setting up Unity version defines for asm definitions in the Editor.
    
*   Search: Fixed search doesn't display all results in project view. It now includes the same result as the legacy search engine (i.e. AssetDatabase.FindAssets). ([1310140](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/search-doesnt-display-all-results-in-project-view))
