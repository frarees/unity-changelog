*   GI: The user observed that their scene was still being lit after they pressed the clear baked data button. This was due to the ambient probe and the default reflection probe, created from the skybox, never being reset. This change very simply resets these fields when the button is pressed.

*   Scripting: C# scripts containing invalid characters in disabled conditional sections are now correctly imported. ([1279339](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-doesnt-recognise-the-script-as-monobehaviour-script-when-theres-a-grave-accent-in-an-number-if-false-block-inside-a-namespace))
    
*   Scripting: Common math and geometry structs such as Vector3 no longer depend on CultureInfo.CurrentCulture to implement ToString method overloads. ([1275065](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/string-dot-format-returns-string-containing-decimal-commas-instead-of-dots-for-vector-types-depending-on-set-cultureinfo))

*   Scripting: Fix modifying Assembly Definitions results in recompile all.  
    When Adding/Removing/Moving we still result in a recompile all. But we are working towards getting this fixed as well. ([1268925](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asmdef-compilationpipeline-reimporting-asmdef-file-without-changes-does-not-respect-compilation-dependencies))
    
*   Scripting: Fix modules being disabled by a platform not getting reenabled when switching platforms which could cause incorrect compiler errors. ([1196164](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/osx-switching-an-urp-template-projects-build-target-to-tvos-will-create-reference-errors-to-xrsettings))

*   Services: Added a fix for the removal of CEF from the editor causing an exception when a tracker is added to a game object.  
    The removal of CEF meant that when analytics is not enabled, and you add an analytics tracker to a game object, the library  
    required to create the "go to service menu and enable analytics" button didn't exist, and thus would throw an exception. The solution was  
    to have a seperate class initialised on load that would override this functionality for all editors that don't have this library. (1277664)
    
*   Shaders: Added Material.SetInteger, Material.GetInteger, MaterialPropertyBlock.SetInteger, MaterialPropertyBlock.GetInteger, Shader.SetGlobalInteger and Shader.GetGlobalInteger that use integers internally; added Integer property type to ShaderLab.

*   Shaders: Removed redundant shader upgrader pass on editor startup. (1274174)
    
*   Shaders: Reset m\_LightmapFlags in Material::ResetWithShader(). ([1283694](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/bug-materials-reset-functionality-doesnt-work-on-emission-in-material))
    
*   Shaders: When set texture parameter to a compute shader, check if it is a RenderTexture and if it has been created. If not, created it. This made sure the RenderTexture is created when ComputeShader.Dispatch is called. ([1261303](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rendertexture-is-not-automatically-created-when-used-as-a-compute-shader-output-calling-computeshader-dot-dispatch))

*   Terrain: Fixes confusing behavior for Lock Width To Height feature when painting trees on Terrain where width is randomized within the specified height range instead of using the randomized height value. (1265350)
    
*   Terrain: Fixes crash that occurs when deleting terrain component during OnTerrainChanged callback. (1281737)
    
*   Terrain: Paint Terrain Help text properly wraps. (1281097)
    
*   Terrain: Paint Tools which are overriden forward shortcut selection to the tool that is overriding them. ([1251645](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/pressing-raise-or-lower-terrain-shortcut-throws-an-error-when-terrain-tools-is-installed))
    
*   Terrain: Painted terrain details now are culled more precisely against hole edges. (1270061)
    
*   Terrain: Re-use of the leaf icon for the tree component as the component icon was missing. ([1260457](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tree-component-icon-is-missing-in-the-inspector))

*   Terrain: When reparenting a element of the tree, all modification made by hand are reset to avoid strange behaviors. (1272795)
    
*   Timeline: Fixed timeline audio playing at the wrong time when Time.timeScale is not 1. ([981046](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/timeline-audio-clips-are-played-early-when-time-scale-is-less-than-1))
    
*   Timeline: Fixed timeline audio playing on timelines with GameTime update mode when Time.timeScale is 0. ([1269783](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/timeline-audio-is-not-paused-when-setting-audiolistener-dot-pause-to-true))
    
*   UI: Canvas RectTransform size calculation now done for standalone renders as well. Camera needs to be enabled to pick up the RenderTexture size change. ([833456](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/canvas-dot-forceupdatecanvases-doesnt-update-canvas-before-camera-dot-render-is-called))

#### Changes

*   Android: Android does not longer make use of QualitySettings.vSyncCount to match iOS behavior.
    
*   Android: Bump Android Logcat verified version to 1.2.0.
    
*   Burst: Bursted DOTS Runtime Jobs are now decorated with `[NativePInvokeCallback]` instead of `[MonoPInvokeCallback]` which could generate callback wrappers which could cause native code to inadvertently interop with the managed VM.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst initialization time.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst Inspector loading time.
    
*   Burst: Improved eager-compilation performance.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of "eager-compilation" (scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed) by cancelling queued eager-compilation when entering play mode with Synchronous Compilation unchecked.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of eager-compilation by not eager-compiling test assemblies.
    
*   Burst: In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, changing the following options in the Burst menu now requires the Editor to be restarted: Enable Compilation, Safety Checks, and Native Debug Mode Compilation. In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, previously-compiled methods will not be recompiled after changing those options, which could lead to undefined behavior where methods may or may not be compiled with the correct options. This change removes that possibility.
    
*   Burst: Made the compiler better at constant-folding complex static readonly constructors.
    
*   Burst: The Burst Inspector no longer uses JIT compilation. The code it shows is now compiled the same way as for editor / player usage.
    
*   Burst: The Burst menu-item `Safety Checks` has been changed to a modal choice of `Off`, `On`, and `Force On`. `Force On` will overwrite any user job or function-pointer with `DisableSafetyChecks = true`. To avoid users falling into the consistent trap of having `Safety Checks` set to `Off`, any reload of the Editor will issue a warning telling the user that `Safety Checks` have been reset to `On`.
    
*   Burst: The command line option `--burst-disable-compilation` is now disabling entirely Burst, including the AppDomain.
    
*   Burst: Updated Cross Compilation Tooling To LLVM 10.
    
*   Burst: Use platform provided memory intrinsics for iOS, tvOS, WASM, and console platforms.
    
*   Burst: Warnings are hidden in the inspector view.
    
*   Burst: When using "Executable Only" build type on Universal Windows Platform, Burst will now only generate code for a single CPU architecture that you're building for.
    
*   Editor: Quick Search is now built-in the Unity Editor and no package needs to be installed.
    
*   Graphics: ComputeBuffer.IsValid now returns false when compute is not supported and ComputeBuffer.BeginWrite throws InvalidOperationException for invalid ComputeBuffers. ([1259525](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-gles3-crash-on-samsung-galaxy-j5-after-launching-gfx-tests))
    
*   Package Manager: The Package Manager no longer discards the existing package state in case of critical errors such as failure to parse the project manifest.
    
*   Scripting: Reintroduced warning that is thrown when a script that is derived from MonoBehaviour has the same name as a built-in component (e.g. Transform).
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.4.3.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Changed the blending equation to allow blending of the resulting RenderTexture.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Improved renderer batching.
    
*   XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 1.5.0.
    
*   XR: Update verified packages for AR Foundation and related packages.

*   Editor: LOD Group values can now be edited via input fields in addition to the slider. Input field editing also works in multi-selection mode.
    
*   Editor: Optimized various parts of texture importing (5%-20% faster depending on settings & texture types used).
    
*   Editor: Optimized various parts of texture importing (~10% faster depending on settings & texture types used).
    
*   Editor: Scene/Game view Gizmos dropdown window now has a search field. (1274775)
    
*   Editor: Two new events added to ObjectSelector: ObjectSelectorSelectionDone: An item in the list is double-clicked; and ObjectSelectorCanceled: The window was closed by explicitly pressing escape on the keyboard.
    
*   GI: Hiding Enlighten specific settings when it is not supported by the SRP. Affected areas are Mesh Renderer, Light, Scene view, Lighting Explorer and Lightmap Parameters.
    
*   Graphics: Improved compression speed for ASTC textures.
    
*   Graphics: Optimized static batching process, e.g. entering play mode with 30k static batched objects in the editor is faster by two seconds.
    
*   IL2CPP: An IL2CPP failure will now result in one (instead of two) error messages. The error message text will be displayed with as little extra information as possible, so that the error is (hopefully) more understandable.
    
*   IL2CPP: When script debugging is enabled, stack traces will now include C# source code line numbers for all assemblies where debug symbols are available.
    
*   Networking: Make UnityWebRequest objects properly show up in profiler. (1017004)

*   Scripting: GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag and GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag are much faster.
    
*   Shaders: #pragma require now works from compute shaders as well.
    
*   SpeedTree: A Fix button now will appear in Mesh Renderer and LOD Group component inspector if Unity detects wrong SpeedTree shader is used (for instance Nature/SpeedTree8 shader is used for meshes that come from SpeedTree 7 assets, and vice versa), and will correct them if clicked. ([1237736](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobject-with-speedtree8-shader-is-distorted-when-moving-trough-lod0-and-lod1-if-fade-mode-is-set-to-speed-tree))
