### 2021.1.16f1 Release Notes

#### Features

*   Android: Users can include custom asset packs into the build, by adding assets to the directory ending with '.androidpack'.
    
*   Android: When building Android App Bundle with Split App Binary enabled, Unity will create asset packs.
    

#### Improvements

*   Virtual Texturing: Tile requests are now returned via `PopRequests` more frequently.
    
*   Virtual Texturing: `InvalidateRegion` calls now generate new tile requests in their "importance" order. The importance is defined as a combination of the tile's screen space size and the the number of frames since the tile has been requested. This makes completing tile requests contribute more to the rendering result when `InvalidateRegion` is called continuously.
    
*   XR: Updated OpenXR package to 1.2.3
    
*   The Package Manager’s global cache root folder, which is used to store downloaded packages, can now be configured using the `UPM_CACHE_ROOT` environment variable or the `cacheRoot` key in the user configuration file
    

#### API Changes

*   Android: Added: New APIs to manage fast-follow and on-demand delivered asset packs. The APIs wrap Google's PlayCore functionality.

#### Changes

*   Android: Gradle Plugin version upgraded from 3.6.0 to 4.0.1.
    
*   Android: Gradle version upgraded from 5.6.4 to 6.1.1.
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.5.6
    
*   Virtual Texturing: Now `PopRequests` allows the destination list to have a different size than the texture stack's `maxActiveRequests` value.
    

#### Fixes

*   AI: Fixed an issue where the NavMesh was generated over a mesh marked as "Not Walkable". ([1109195](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/navmesh-is-created-on-top-of-the-object-when-it-is-set-as-not-walkable-and-the-object-is-close-to-any-walkable-object))
