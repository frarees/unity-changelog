*   GI: The user observed that their scene was still being lit after they pressed the clear baked data button. This was due to the ambient probe and the default reflection probe, created from the skybox, never being reset. This change very simply resets these fields when the button is pressed. ([1200802](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gi-clearing-bake-data-does-not-sync-to-game-view-or-scene-view-immediately))
    
*   GI: The user observed that upon deleting a lightmapped scene object and undoing the deletion, the scene object was no longer being lit. This was caused by the fact that we do not serialize lightmapping data such as indices and ST. This change explicitly handles the case where a lightmapped scene object is deleted in an undo-able manner. ([1225425](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-lightmaps-are-not-restored-after-removing-baked-gameobject-and-undoing))

    Fixed issue on Switch where declaration of a texture with full-float precision was ignored.
    
*   Graphics: Added missing script API taking GraphicsBuffer parameters, for SetBufferCounterValue and SetBufferData.
    
*   Graphics: Added Shader Precision Model into Player Settings, to change between current platform defaults and the new Unified Model. Unified model defaults to full sampler precision on all platforms, but allows declaring lower precision explicitly and use FP16 ops on targets where available. (1280157)

It also no longer clamps vertex colors to UNorm8 format - if input meshes have higher precision vertex colors, then combined mesh will have high precision colors too.

#### Changes

*   Android: Android does not longer make use of QualitySettings.vSyncCount to match iOS behavior.
    
*   Android: Bump Android Logcat verified version to 1.2.0.
    
*   Android: Vulkan is no longer preferred over OpenGL ES when using Android 7 and for all Mali Midgard GPUs.
    
*   Burst: Burst enters RC phase.
    
*   Burst: Bursted DOTS Runtime Jobs are now decorated with `[NativePInvokeCallback]` instead of `[MonoPInvokeCallback]` which could generate callback wrappers which could cause native code to inadvertently interop with the managed VM.
    
*   Burst: Eager-compilation is now cancelled when script compilation starts, to prevent spurious errors related to recompiled assemblies.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst initialization time.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst Inspector loading time.
    
*   Burst: Improved eager-compilation performance.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of "eager-compilation" (scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed) by cancelling queued eager-compilation when entering play mode with Synchronous Compilation unchecked.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of eager-compilation by not eager-compiling test assemblies.
    
*   Burst: In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, changing the following options in the Burst menu now requires the Editor to be restarted: Enable Compilation, Safety Checks, and Native Debug Mode Compilation. In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, previously-compiled methods will not be recompiled after changing those options, which could lead to undefined behavior where methods may or may not be compiled with the correct options. This change removes that possibility.
    
*   Burst: Made the compiler better at constant-folding complex static readonly constructors.
    
*   Burst: Open-generic static methods are not supported by Burst, but they were previously visible in Burst InspectorBurst: they are now hidden.
    
*   Burst: The Burst Inspector no longer uses JIT compilation. The code it shows is now compiled the same way as for editor / player usage.
    
*   Burst: The Burst menu-item `Safety Checks` has been changed to a modal choice of `Off`, `On`, and `Force On`. `Force On` will overwrite any user job or function-pointer with `DisableSafetyChecks = true`. To avoid users falling into the consistent trap of having `Safety Checks` set to `Off`, any reload of the Editor will issue a warning telling the user that `Safety Checks` have been reset to `On`.
    
*   Burst: The command line option `--burst-disable-compilation` is now disabling entirely Burst, including the AppDomain.
    
*   Burst: Updated Cross Compilation Tooling To LLVM 10.
    
*   Burst: Use platform provided memory intrinsics for iOS, tvOS, WASM, and console platforms.
    
*   Burst: Warnings are hidden in the inspector view.
    
*   Burst: When using "Executable Only" build type on Universal Windows Platform, Burst will now only generate code for a single CPU architecture that you're building for.
    
*   Editor: Quick Search is now built-in the Unity Editor and no package needs to be installed.

*   Burst: Added a compiler warning for any use of throwing an exception from a method **not guarded by** `[Conditional("ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS")]`. Since exceptions in Burst are only supported in the editor, this provides a useful warning to users who may be relying on try/catch behaviors for control-flow which is not supported in final game builds.

*   Package Manager: Updated Package Manager UI version tags for new Lifecycle and logic for recommending/showing available versions to users.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added support for azimuthAngle, altitudeAngle, twist, and multiple Pen devices in EventSystem when using Input System package.
