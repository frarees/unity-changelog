    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed regression preventing both required component and the dependent from both being removed from a prefab instance. ([1277654](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cannot-deserialize-prefab-instance-when-required-and-dependent-components-are-removed))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed that there is no information provided about the Prefab when a Prefab's child has broken references after using ForceReserializeAssets. ([1262196](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/there-is-no-information-provided-about-the-parent-when-prefabs-child-has-broken-references-after-using-forcereserializeassets))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed using 'Clear Parent' menu item in Prefab Mode. ([1288117](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefabs-undo-doesnt-work-after-clear-parent-action-is-performed-for-an-opened-prefab-object))  
    _This is a change to a 2021.1.0a1 change, not seen in any released version, and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Prefabs: Improved error handling when loading broken prefab files. ([1278298](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-getcomponentsimplementation-00-when-opening-a-prefab))
    
*   Profiler: Fixed an issue where FrameCount inside the ProfilerUserSettings would clamp to a 0 - 2000 frame range instead of 300 - 2000, thus causing the charts inside the ProfilerWindow to throw out of range exceptions. (1288878)  
    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Profiler: Fixed CPU Recorder sampleBlockCount is unstable depending of thread scheduling. (1201319)  
    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Profiler: Fixed gc allocation in unsafe version of Profiler.EmitFrameMetaData. (1281405)  
    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Profiler: Fixed issue where entering PlayMode with the editor open would throw "GetInt is not allowed error". ([1289794](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-getint-is-not-allowed-error-is-thrown-when-entering-the-play-mode-while-profiler-is-recording-the-editor))  
    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Profiler: Hierarchy Views randomly collapsing (i.e. hiding their children) parts of the sample tree when Editor Only samples are present in a frame and the "Collapse EditorOnly Samples" option is turned on (default setting is on).
    
*   Profiler: Selections CPU or GPU samples made in the CPU Usage and GPU Usage Profiler Modules now carry over correctly and persistently to all views (Timeline, Hierarchy, Raw Hierarchy) as well as to all frames that contain them. In frames other than the one the selection was originally made in, the selection will point to the first sample that provides the best match to the stack of sample names that lead up to that original sample. So if there are e.g. multiple Components of the same type "MyComponent", and you select the "MyComponent.Update()" sample of one of them, there is no way for the Profiler to identify the "MyComponent.Update()" sample of exactly that sample Component in the next frame. It will therefore just select the very first "MyComponent.Update()" sample it can find. If a part of the Sample Stack is missing in a frame, the selection Tooltip in Timeline or an extra line at the bottom of the Hierarchy views will alert you of the fact, that the selection that was carried over to this frame is just an approximation. An option was added to show the difference in this approximated Sample Stack, and the originally selected Sample Stack. If not even one of the sample names from the original selection fits the samples in a particular frame and thread, no selection will be displayed. If a selection was made on a thread other than the Main Thread, switching to the Hierarchy Views will automatically switch them to the right thread this selection was made in.

*   Shaders: Support Texture.CalculateLevelOfDetail function in Metal shaders. (1237836)
    
*   UI: Fallback to non SRP when rendering uGUI's profiler rerender even if SRP is in use. ([1275870](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-srp-ui-objects-are-not-displayed-and-a-wrong-background-is-displayed-in-the-ui-preview-window-when-srp-is-used))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed an issue in D3D12 where disabling VSync didn't allow running at unlocked frame rate. ([1289170](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/disabling-vsync-doesnt-work-on-uwp-when-using-d3d12))

    _This has already been backported to older releases and will not be mentioned in final notes._
    
*   Video: Enabled the previously disabled tests and re-ran them on PS4 and Android on Katana with testRepetitions set to 100. (1068853)
    
*   Video: Uncommented the EndReached callback in VideoPlayback playmode tests and updated the tests since the original fix for the callback issue had landed. (1062515)
    
*   XR: Utilize volume up and down buttons on VR devices to confirm and proceed when Android dialog is not visible on VR devices instead of only restricting to click "Ok" button on screen.

*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed issue where Assertion failed on expression: 'txn.IsBlacklistEmpty()' was being triggered, due to certain checks not happening before a Refresh was deemed completed. ([1247090](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-gforcereimports-empty-is-thrown-when-saving-so-to-assetdatabase))

*   Burst: Fixed a bug where the mm256\_cvtepi32\_ps intrinsic would crash the compiler.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug whereby for platforms that require us to write intermediate LLVM bitcode files, UTF paths would be incorrectly handled.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug with constant expressions that could cause a compile-time hang.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug with float/double vector constructors of `Unity.Mathematics` that take half or half vector parameters.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a poor error message when a generic unsupported type (like a class or an auto-layout struct) combined with an unsupported managed array (like (int, float)\[\]) wouldn't give the user any context on where the code went wrong.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an internal compiler error when nested managed static readonly arrays were used (produces a proper Burst error instead now).
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue that could prevent the Editor from shutting down.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where UNITY\_DOTSPLAYER builds not building for NET\_DOTS would be unable to compile do to references to UnityEngine.

*   GI: The user observed that their scene was still being lit after they pressed the clear baked data button. This was due to the ambient probe and the default reflection probe, created from the skybox, never being reset. This change very simply resets these fields when the button is pressed. ([1200802](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gi-clearing-bake-data-does-not-sync-to-game-view-or-scene-view-immediately))
    
*   GI: The user observed that upon deleting a lightmapped scene object and undoing the deletion, the scene object was no longer being lit. This was caused by the fact that we do not serialize lightmapping data such as indices and ST. This change explicitly handles the case where a lightmapped scene object is deleted in an undo-able manner. ([1225425](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-lightmaps-are-not-restored-after-removing-baked-gameobject-and-undoing))

*   Profiler: Fixes a race condition in the Shadow Casters stat observed as part of case 1265648, which can cause inconsistent collection of the stat. (1265648)
    
*   Profiler: Hierarchy Views randomly collapsing (i.e. hiding their children) parts of the sample tree when Editor Only samples are present in a frame and the "Collapse EditorOnly Samples" option is turned on (default setting is on).
    
*   Profiler: Selections CPU or GPU samples made in the CPU Usage and GPU Usage Profiler Modules now carry over correctly and persistently to all views (Timeline, Hierarchy, Raw Hierarchy) as well as to all frames that contain them. In frames other than the one the selection was originally made in, the selection will point to the first sample that provides the best match to the stack of sample names that lead up to that original sample. So if there are e.g. multiple Components of the same type "MyComponent", and you select the "MyComponent.Update()" sample of one of them, there is no way for the Profiler to identify the "MyComponent.Update()" sample of exactly that sample Component in the next frame. It will therefore just select the very first "MyComponent.Update()" sample it can find. If a part of the Sample Stack is missing in a frame, the selection Tooltip in Timeline or an extra line at the bottom of the Hierarchy views will alert you of the fact, that the selection that was carried over to this frame is just an approximation. An option was added to show the difference in this approximated Sample Stack, and the originally selected Sample Stack. If not even one of the sample names from the original selection fits the samples in a particular frame and thread, no selection will be displayed. If a selection was made on a thread other than the Main Thread, switching to the Hierarchy Views will automatically switch them to the right thread this selection was made in.

#### Changes

*   Android: Android does not longer make use of QualitySettings.vSyncCount to match iOS behavior.
    
*   Android: Bump Android Logcat verified version to 1.2.0.
    
*   Android: Vulkan is no longer preferred over OpenGL ES when using Android 7 and for all Mali Midgard GPUs.
    
*   Asset Import: Changed Alembic verified package to 2.1.1-pre.1.
    
*   Burst: Burst enters RC phase.
    
*   Burst: Bursted DOTS Runtime Jobs are now decorated with `[NativePInvokeCallback]` instead of `[MonoPInvokeCallback]` which could generate callback wrappers which could cause native code to inadvertently interop with the managed VM.
    
*   Burst: Eager-compilation is now cancelled when script compilation starts, to prevent spurious errors related to recompiled assemblies.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst initialization time.
    
*   Burst: Improved Burst Inspector loading time.
    
*   Burst: Improved eager-compilation performance.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of "eager-compilation" (scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed) by cancelling queued eager-compilation when entering play mode with Synchronous Compilation unchecked.
    
*   Burst: Improved performance of eager-compilation by not eager-compiling test assemblies.
    
*   Burst: In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, changing the following options in the Burst menu now requires the Editor to be restarted: Enable Compilation, Safety Checks, and Native Debug Mode Compilation. In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, previously-compiled methods will not be recompiled after changing those options, which could lead to undefined behavior where methods may or may not be compiled with the correct options. This change removes that possibility.
    
*   Burst: Made the compiler better at constant-folding complex static readonly constructors.
    
*   Burst: Open-generic static methods are not supported by Burst, but they were previously visible in Burst InspectorBurst: they are now hidden.
    
*   Burst: Temporarily removed the Burst compiler warning about exception throws not in \[Conditional("ENABLE\_UNITY\_COLLECTIONS\_CHECKS")\] methods, to let us address user feedback. The next minor version of Burst will reincorporate this in a more friendly manner.
    
*   Burst: The Burst Inspector no longer uses JIT compilation. The code it shows is now compiled the same way as for editor / player usage.
    
*   Burst: The Burst menu-item `Safety Checks` has been changed to a modal choice of `Off`, `On`, and `Force On`. `Force On` will overwrite any user job or function-pointer with `DisableSafetyChecks = true`. To avoid users falling into the consistent trap of having `Safety Checks` set to `Off`, any reload of the Editor will issue a warning telling the user that `Safety Checks` have been reset to `On`.
    
*   Burst: The command line option `--burst-disable-compilation` is now disabling entirely Burst, including the AppDomain.
    
*   Burst: Updated Cross Compilation Tooling To LLVM 10.
    
*   Burst: Use platform provided memory intrinsics for iOS, tvOS, WASM, and console platforms.
    
*   Burst: Warnings are hidden in the inspector view.
    
*   Burst: When using "Executable Only" build type on Universal Windows Platform, Burst will now only generate code for a single CPU architecture that you're building for.
    
*   Editor: Quick Search is now built-in the Unity Editor and no package needs to be installed.
    
*   Graphics: Changed so texture formats DXT1 and DXT5 in the UI labels are now named "DXT1|BC1" and "DXT5|BC3", indicating terminology used by modern graphics APIs.
    
*   Graphics: Changed switch shaders to now use separate samplers instead of combined texture-samplers objects.
    
*   Graphics: ComputeBuffer.IsValid now returns false when compute is not supported and ComputeBuffer.BeginWrite throws InvalidOperationException for invalid ComputeBuffers. ([1259525](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-gles3-crash-on-samsung-galaxy-j5-after-launching-gfx-tests))
    
*   Graphics: Texture2D.Compress now compressed R8 textures to BC4 and R8G8 textures to BC5, on mobile platforms ETC/EAC are used.
    
*   Graphics: VT-internal warnings no longer show up in the editor window, but still get printed into the editor log file.
    
*   Package Manager: The Package Manager no longer discards the existing package state in case of critical errors such as failure to parse the project manifest.
    
*   Scripting: Changed NativeArray limit of 2GiB in size, and now it can contain 2^31 items instead.
    
*   Scripting: Reintroduced warning that is thrown when a script that is derived from MonoBehaviour has the same name as a built-in component (e.g. Transform).
    
*   Scripting: Roslyn Analyzers inside Assembly Definitions Folders are now only applied to the Asmdef Assembly itself and to other Assemblies referencing the Asmdef Assembly - but not to any other code in the project.
    
*   Shaders: Editor now skips warming up shaders from shader collections in the Preloaded shaders section of Graphics settings.
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.4.3.
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.4.4.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Changed are now called on bound field when value is first set on the control and matches default value. (1273589)
    
*   UI Toolkit: Changed DynamicAtlas system to track texture references and support dynamic removals.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Changed the blending equation to allow blending of the resulting RenderTexture.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Improved renderer batching.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Updated menu item for Live Reload to be called "UI Toolkit Live Reload" to avoid user confusion.
    
*   XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 1.5.0.
    
*   XR: Update verified packages for AR Foundation and related packages.

#### Features

*   2D: Added an option to enable/disable Alpha Dilate for SpriteAtlas.  
    This adds ability to use Alpha Transparency for padding pixels around Sprite Borders when packing SpriteAtlas.
    
*   2D: Added Isometric Grid slicing to Sprite Editor.
    
*   2D: Added support to allow user to toggle drawing of Grid Gizmo in the Tile Palette window with a button in the Tile Palette window.
    
*   2D: Added support to allow users to toggle drawing of Grid Gizmo for a Grid component in the SceneView using the SceneView Gizmo button or through the list in the Gizmo dropdown.
    
*   2D: Allow showing of confirmation dialog when Apply or Revert button on Sprite Editor Window in pressed. This can be turned on or off in Preferences.
    
*   Burst: A new option `[BurstCompile(DisableSafetyChecks = true)]` that allows per job or function-pointer disabling of safety checks. This allows users to have blessed code run fast always.
    
*   Burst: Added a compiler warning for any use of throwing an exception from a method **not guarded by** `[Conditional("ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS")]`. Since exceptions in Burst are only supported in the editor, this provides a useful warning to users who may be relying on try/catch behaviors for control-flow which is not supported in final game builds.
    
*   Burst: Added first batch of Arm Neon intrinsics. Currently, only ArmV8 (AArch64) targets are supported. The supported intrinsics include all ArmV7 and ArmV8 ones.
    
*   Burst: Added intrinsics support for `AtomicSafetyHandle.NewStaticSafetyId`.
    
*   Burst: Added support for try/finally and using/foreach for IDisposable patterns.
    
*   Burst: Added support to load additional burst libraries in playmode/standalone for the intention of allowing Modding support on desktop platforms.
    
*   Burst: Added `BurstCompiler.IsEnabled` API.
    
*   Burst: An error message if attempting to BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer() on a multicast delegate, since this is not supported in Burst.
    
*   Burst: Burst compilation status is now displayed in the Background Tasks window in Unity 2020.1 and above (click the spinner in the bottom-right of the Editor to open this window).
    
*   Burst: Experimental support for tvOS.
    
*   Burst: Improve Editor experience by scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed, instead of waiting until Play Mode is entered.
    
*   Burst: Improved our aliasing detection to allow `DynamicBuffer` structs to be easily vectorizable.
    
*   Burst: Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 10.0.0 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.
    
*   Burst: VS 2017 support for platform that needs it.
    
*   Burst: You can now select explicit x86/x64 architecture SIMD target for Universal Windows Platform.
    
*   Editor: Added Device Simulator window as a core feature of the Editor.
    
*   Graphics: Mesh sampling skinned & Index.
    
*   Package Manager: Added a new `add package by name` dropdown and revamped the existing `add from git URL` dropdown.
    
*   Package Manager: Give the users more choices concerning the load next value to load their assets in My assets filter.
    
*   Package Manager: Infobox text that describes the current flow of the package when the version is not a Release.
    
*   Package Manager: Removed 'See all versions' option in version list for external users, added Project Setting for internal users to re-enable this option.
    
*   Package Manager: Updated Package Manager UI version tags for new Lifecycle and logic for recommending/showing available versions to users.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added support for azimuthAngle, altitudeAngle, twist, and multiple Pen devices in EventSystem when using Input System package.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added UI Builder, a visual UI authoring tool for UI Toolkit. It was initially released as a package (com.unity.ui.builder) and is now part of core Unity for its 1.0 full release.
