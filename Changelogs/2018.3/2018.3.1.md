-   Graphics: Fixed an issue where unbound UAVs in shaders would cause the Editor to crash. ([988911](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dx12-editor-switch-to-dx12-editor-crashes-if-object-in-scene-is-using-a-shader-with-uav-texture), 1098906)

-   Graphics: Fixed appdata not zero-initialized in domain shader causing compiler error about out parameter not being fully initialized.

-   iOS: Make \"textures used in draw call\" use our hash_set instead of std::set. (1061553)

-   Prefabs: Fixed PrefabUtility.GetAddedGameObjects so it doesn\'t return added GameObjects that are themselves under added GameObjects. This is consistent with what we show in the Overrides dropdown. (1104805)

-   Shaders: Fixed ComputeShader.SetTextureFromGlobal() to work with 3d textures. ([1088840](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/computeshader-dot-settexturefromglobal-errors-when-using-it-with-3d-rendertexture), 1104047)

-   Shaders: Fixed Shader bundle does not rebuild when changing an included HLSL file. ([1064917](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-bundle-does-not-rebuild-when-changing-an-included-hlsl-file))
