*   Android: Touch and mouse position's y value will be inverted in the native backend instead of managed code in the new input system.
    
*   Animation: Fixed Animator.keepAnimatorControllerStateOnDisable not keeping default values when disabling and re-enabling a GameObject. ([1076483](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animator-dot-keepanimatorcontrollerstateondisable-doesnt-keep-default-values-when-disabling-and-re-enabling-a-gameobject), 1137982)

*   IL2CPP: Fixed SocketException not thrown when a socket attempts to bind to an address and port that is already in use by another socket on Windows. ([1133587](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-il2cpp-standalone-player-does-not-throw-an-error-when-initializing-multiple-tcplisteners-with-the-same-port-number), 1134332)
    
*   IL2CPP: Improved the performance of Socket Poll operations on iOS. ([1136660](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-il2cpp-regression-between-17-dot-4-16-and-18-dot-3-7-100-percent-cpu-usage-when-polling-a-socket), 1139296)

*   iOS: Fixed Gamepad.startButton not working correctly. Note: on iOS startButton (or Menu button) only reports down event, there's no up event, that's why we're simulating up event right after down event to simulate a click.
    
*   iOS: Fixed occasional crash when destroying WebCamTexture. ([1090053](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-loading-a-scene-after-calling-webcamtexture-dot-getpixels-causes-the-game-to-crash), 1108709)

*   Mobile: Fixed Application.Unload crashing on il2cpp. (1135018, 1140281)
    
*   Mobile: Fixed rare race condition when warming up shaders. ([1115274](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-on-device-shader-compilation-hangs-~10-percent-of-the-time-on-the-specific-project), 1134733)
    
*   Mono: Prevented a TypeLoadException which can occur in the player at run time when the Medium or High managed stripping level is used with the Mono scripting backend. ([1121958](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/managed-code-stripping-results-in-typeloadexception-vtable-setup-of-type-buildlogger-failed), 1135047)
    
*   Particles: Fixed an issue where 1 particle of each mesh type would be rendered, when a system did not actually have any particles using that mesh, when using GPU Instancing. ([1139308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gpu-instancing-extra-mesh-particles-are-being-spawned-when-using-gpu-instancing), 1140353)
    
*   Particles: Fixed crash when resetting Particle System component via the cog wheel in the Editor. ([1131320](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shuriken-editor-crashes-on-resetting-particle-system-properties-via-cogwheel), 1140344)

*   Particles: Fixed particles not being removed from the system when using SetParticles with zero remaining lifetime. ([1130703](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particles-not-being-removed-from-array-when-remaininglifetime-equals-0-is-used), 1140343)
    
*   Particles: Fixed per-particle sorting work when using GPU Instanced particles. ([1139313](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gpu-instancing-sort-mode-does-not-work-for-gpu-instanced-meshes), 1140350)
    
*   Particles: Fixed texture property issue with Trails texture and Sprite mode being used together. ([1127679](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-trails-sprites-modifies-unexpectedly-when-texture-sheet-animation-is-enabled), 1140346)
    
*   Scene Management: Fixed API and UI incorrectly reporting added/removed object overrides on disconnected Prefab instances. (1115758, 1134971)
    
*   Scene Management: Fixed driven properties causing RectTransform to temporarily show up in Overrides dropdown after reverting or applying anything in the Comparison view. (1131854, 1135007)
    
*   Scene Management: Fixed Prefab instances with driven properties showing Apply All and Revert All buttons in Overrides dropdown even when there are no overrides. (1131854, 1135007)
    
*   SceneManager: Ensure nested Canvases are always treated as nested Canvases in Prefab Mode too. Root World Space Canvases can get treated as nested Canvases in Prefab Mode too due to lacking information, but this will still have fewer downsides than if nested Canvases got treated as Root Canvases. ([1132706](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-canvass-screen-space-overlay-mode-breaks-canvas-in-the-editor-while-working-fine-in-the-prefab-mode), 1139184)
    
*   SceneManager: Fixed RectTransform properties of nested Canvas getting incorrectly modified upon entering Prefab Mode. ([1132796](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-value-of-recttransform-of-a-nested-canvas-in-prefab-is-reset-after-modifying-and-exiting-in-prefab-mode), 1144694)
    
*   Scripting: Improved performance when calling GameObject.AddComponent for a nested MonoBehaviour class inside a namespace. ([1085304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobject-dot-addcomponent-performance-severely-degrades-in-execution-time-with-each-call-when-the-call-is-inside-a-namespace), 1118037)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed broken shaders referencing editor only passes with UsePass. ([1135888](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shaders-referencing-meta-or-other-editor-only-passes-via-usepass-fail-on-standalone-build), 1139214)

([1120186](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-when-accessing-playabledirector-component-of-a-gameobject-instantiated-from-an-asset-file), 1129365)
