- 2D: Added previews in the Scene view for Sprite Rect size and pivot changes that are made in the Sprite Editor window.

- 2D: Added support for integrating AI-powered workflows to the Sprite Editor window.

- Editor: Added a new "Force GC on Scene Load" option to the Editor Scene Handling section in the Project Settings. Disabling this option prevents forced garbage collection \(GC\) and unused asset unloading when loading a scene in the Editor. This can improve performance \(sometimes significantly\) although it can also affect  when managed object finalizers are called, which, in rare circumstances, might be an issue depending on the project.

- Graphics: Added a Mesh Level of Detail \(LOD\) generator in the `MeshLodGeneration` module. This generator creates LODs for a specified mesh and is accessible through the API and the Mesh Import Inspector.

- Graphics: Added an option for Renderers to select and render a specific Mesh Level of Detail \(LOD\).

- Graphics: Implemented a specific case to allow apps to manually perform MSAA resolve in shaders using VK_QCOM_render_pass_shader_resolve.

- Graphics: Introduced Mesh LOD, a Level of Detail \(LOD\) system that enables efficient rendering of LODs embedded within meshes. It includes a generator, API, and rendering functionality.

- HDRP: Added a new injection point for custom pass just after the opaque objects are rendered.

- HDRP: Upgraded FSR2 from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1. These are the release notes for FSR2:<br>
    - Fixed a DRS issue where resource were not correctly cleared on first use.<br>
    - Fixed an issue where luma instability logic could introduce output artefacts with strobing lights.<br>
    - Fixed an incorrect luma resource size.

- Version Control: Added an "Enter" keyboard shortcut to most dialogs to confirm the operation like the corresponding button.

- Version Control: Added an action to copy to the clipboard the name of the current branch to the status bar.

- Version Control: Added avatars for authors of changes in the merge view.

- Version Control: Added functionality to Shelve your Pending Changes when you switch to another branch or changeset. You can also decide if you want to apply those changes automatically after the switch.

- Version Control: Added the user avatar, if it's available from Gravatar, to the pending changes view.

- Version Control: Added to the list of branches a context action to hide branches. You can use the filter to list the hidden branches and unhide them from the context menu.

- Version Control: You can now create a code review from the list of branches or changesets and open either the Desktop App or the Unity Cloud website.

- Web: Added preconfigured build profiles to the Web Platform that implement optimizations to improve performance based on best practices found in Unity's documentation. In addition, development build profiles have been added that reduce build times to help improve developer productivity.

#### Changes

- 2D: Removed com.unity.2d.pixel-perfect package from 2D URP template because users should be using the PixelPerfect feature that comes with 2D URP.
    (UUM-95753)

- Android: Addded Android SDK 36 support.

- Android: Added `unity.agpVersion` to the gradle.properties file.

- Android: Enabled predictive back gesture support by default for new projects.

- Asset Import: Improved the error message displayed when the Editor loses connection to an Asset Import Worker process.

- Build Pipeline: Enabled building AssetBundles with both the DisableTypeTree and StripUnityVersion flags. Fixed the ability to load these AssetBundles at runtime.
    ([UUM-102575](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-error-is-thrown-when-building-assetbundles-with-disablewritetypetree-and-stripunityversion-flags))

- Core: Throw an error if an HDRP compiler function is used from the NRP compiler.

- Documentation: Review documentation about UniversalRenderer.CreateRenderGraphTexture.

- Editor: AI toolbar button now also installs Inference Engine.

- Editor: Editor: Improved RepositoryInfo API documentation.

- Editor: Editor: Improved Request\(Generic\) API documentation.

- Editor: Improved synchronization between `activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged` and `activeRenderPipelineTypeChanged`. The `activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged` event is now always called before `activeRenderPipelineTypeChanged`.

- Editor: Improved the error message in the Editor to prevent Players from being built inside `PlayerLoop`.
    (UUM-90979)

- Editor: Updated the Terrain Tools package to version 5.2.1.

- EmbeddedLinux: Removed unused LGPL libusb code from SDL.

- Graphics: Deprecated the ETC legacy compressor.

- Graphics: Updated R8G8B8A8 and B8G8R8A8 sRGB formats to report LoadStore as unsupported on Intel Macs. This change reflects that sRGB writes are explicitly not supported on these devices.
    (UUM-95478)

- HDRP: Corrected the displayName value in the `package.json` file to match the official package name "High Definition Render Pipeline".

- HDRP: Rendering Debugger - Moved decals to the Rendering Section.

    ([UUM-92304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/consolidating-rendering-settings-in-the-rendering-debugger))

- IMGUI: TreeViews are now generic. If you were before using `TreeView`, `TreeViewItem` and `TreeViewState`, you can likely now use `TreeView<int>`, `TreeViewItem<int>` and `TreeViewState<int>`, and not think more about it. But if you were using that identifier to store InstanceID data, you should instead opt to upgrade your TreeViews to use `TreeView<InstanceID>` to get the proper typing.

- iOS: Modified the interface between the Trampoline and Unity Player for setting up backbuffer. The recommend best practice is not to modify the way the trampoline sets up the backbuffer, but if you do, please note that now we UnityViewSwapchain struct instead of passing whole UnityDisplaySurfaceMTL. Currently, the backward compatibility is preserved and we still UnityDisplaySurfaceMTL members that are related to drawables, but soon we will move it from this completely.

- Kepler: Updated the `onReconfigure` event to pass system values to its callbacks and delegates.

- Linux: Removed unused LGPL libusb code from SDL.

- macOS: Updated the behavior for activating a secondary display so that it no longer forces the main window to switch to fullscreen mode.

- Package Manager: Changed the default value of `overrideBuiltins` to prevent breaking user projects that override built-in packages during an upgrade.

- Package Manager: Included the optional `isDiscoverable` property as a nested field within the `UnityLifecycleInfo` object.

- QNX: Removed unused LGPL libusb code from SDL.

- Scripting: Removed outdated `ApiUpdater` configurations that were causing issues.
    ([UUM-77628](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/script-updater-for-unity-dot-2d-dot-pixelperfect-dot-editor-dot-dll-failed-when-creating-a-new-project-in-unity-6000))

    ([UUM-92304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/consolidating-rendering-settings-in-the-rendering-debugger))

- SRP Core: Rendering Debugger - Moved the GPU Resident Drawer to the Rendering Section.
    ([UUM-92304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/consolidating-rendering-settings-in-the-rendering-debugger))

- Universal RP: Removed the `inputSummary.requiresColorTextureCreated` property in favor of using `scriptableRenderPass.requireIntermediateTexture`, which provides the same functionality.

- URP: Corrected the displayName value in the `package.json` file to match the official package name "Universal Render Pipeline".

- Version Control: Added dedicated toolbar buttons to open the list of branches and the Branch Explorer of the Desktop App.

- Version Control: Changed the changeset context menu item *Undo this change* to *Revert this file to the previous revision* to be more explicit.

- Version Control: Improved the Create workspace window to suggest the matching Unity Cloud project if it exists.

- Version Control: Moved the *Unity Version Control* menu item under *Window'/'Version Control* to a submenu.

- Version Control: Optimized incoming changes and merge so the Package Manager only reload when it is needed.

- Version Control: Serialized the Checkin comment and tick selection so they are retained on domain reload and in Play mode.

- XR: Updated the Meta Quest default package to be OpenXR Plugin \(`com.unity.xr.openxr`\).

- XR: Updated the Oculus XR Plugin package to version 4.5.1.

- XR: Updated the OpenXR Plugin package to version to 1.14.3.
