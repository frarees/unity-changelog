### New 6000.2.0a4 Entries since 6000.2.0a1

#### Improvements

- 2D: Added support for Sprite GPU Skinning in ShaderGraph now that SRP-Batcher with GPU Skinning for 2D has landed. This will fix cases where "Material is using a shader without GPU deformation support. Switching the renderer over to CPU deformation" error is thrown.
    ([UUM-91954](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dot-dot-dot-is-using-a-shader-without-gpu-deformation-support-switching-the-renderer-over-to-cpu-deformation-dot-warnings-are-logged-when-gpu-skinning-is-set-to-gpu))<br>
    *First seen in 6000.2.0a1.*

- AI: Improved the calculation of NavMesh paths and corners to run slightly faster.

- Build Pipeline: Added .pdb files for all platform Editor extensions to improve logging and provide more detailed information in case of exceptions in platform Editor code.

- Documentation: Added a copy button to code examples in the documentation.

- Editor: Added a feature to recover `SceneBackup` files when launching the Editor. Users can open these backup files to restore and copy any lost work to their scene assets.

- Editor: Added the *3D Placement Mode* option to the Scene View preferences where you can use raycasts to select a better initial position for new objects. This resolves common poor placement cases like new objects clipping into existing geometry, being placed below the floor level, or being placed floating in space.

- GI: Modified OpenCL GPU device detection to occur when opening the Lighting window instead of during the first bake operation.

- iOS: Added support for `CAMetalDisplayLink`. This feature is enabled by default on iOS when built with Xcode 15 or later and run on iOS 17 or later. You can override it at runtime by modifying the `UnityAppController shouldUseMetalDisplayLink` method. By default, this feature is disabled on tvOS because most devices are slower. Failing to maintain the target FPS in complex scenes may produce misleading GPU hang warnings.
    ([UUM-66493](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-framerate-drops-when-screen-is-touched-on-promotion-devices))

- Kepler: Icon setting is exported to manifest.

- Shadergraph: Added a new *Shader Graph UGUI Shaders* sample content set to the Shader Graph package. This sample demonstrates how to use the new Canvas target in Shader Graph to create dynamic UI elements. You can import this sample from the *Samples* tab in the Package Manager after selecting the Shader Graph package.

- SRP Core: Added an API to query the preferred depth-only format for target platforms.

- Text: Improved the performance of Auto Text Generation \(ATG\) by implementing multithreading for generating multiple TextElement objects.

- URP: Implemented minor CPU optimizations for the Post-Processing Bloom effect.<br>
    Enhanced code quality by consistently using TextureDesc in place of RenderTextureDescriptor.



#### API Changes

- Android: Added: Added `AndroidExternalToolsSettings.gradleUserHomePath`, which you can use to set gradle home path.
    (UUM-92289)

- Package Manager: Obsoleted: Made the `IShouldIncludeInBuildCallback` interface and the `BuildUtilities.RegisterShouldIncludeInBuildCallback` API obsolete.

- Particles: Added: Added the `applyActiveColorSpace` property to `ParticleSystem`, `LineRenderer`, and `TrailRenderer`.

- Physics 2D: Added: Added the `Collider2D.CanContact` method, which checks if two colliders can ever come into contact.

- Physics 2D: Added: Added `Collider2D.contactMask` property, which calculates the effective `LayerMask`. This includes both the Layer Collision Matrix settings along with any Rigidbody2D and Collider2D layer overrides specified.

- Physics 2D: Added: Added `PolygonCollider2D.CreateFromSprite` which calculates new PolygonCollider2D paths from a specific Sprite as is done automatically when a PolygonCollider2D is first added.

- Physics 2D: Deprecated: Deprecated the `ContactFilter2D.NoFilter` method. Use the static property `ContactFilter2D.noFilter` instead.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added support to reorder tabs, and to retrieve tabs and tab headers.



#### Changes

- Documentation: Review documentation about UniversalRenderer.CreateRenderGraphTexture.

- Editor: Editor: Improved Request\(Generic\) API documentation.

- Graphics: Updated R8G8B8A8 and B8G8R8A8 sRGB formats to report LoadStore as unsupported on Intel Macs. This change reflects that sRGB writes are explicitly not supported on these devices.
    (UUM-95478)

### Preview of Final 6000.2.0a4 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- AI: Improved the calculation of NavMesh paths and corners to run slightly faster.

- Build Pipeline: Added .pdb files for all platform Editor extensions to improve logging and provide more detailed information in case of exceptions in platform Editor code.

- Documentation: Added a copy button to code examples in the documentation.

- Editor: Added a feature to recover `SceneBackup` files when launching the Editor. Users can open these backup files to restore and copy any lost work to their scene assets.

- Editor: Added the *3D Placement Mode* option to the Scene View preferences where you can use raycasts to select a better initial position for new objects. This resolves common poor placement cases like new objects clipping into existing geometry, being placed below the floor level, or being placed floating in space.

- Editor: All colors from `Color.cs` are now presented as defaults in the Color Picker window.

- GI: Modified OpenCL GPU device detection to occur when opening the Lighting window instead of during the first bake operation.

- iOS: Added support for `CAMetalDisplayLink`. This feature is enabled by default on iOS when built with Xcode 15 or later and run on iOS 17 or later. You can override it at runtime by modifying the `UnityAppController shouldUseMetalDisplayLink` method. By default, this feature is disabled on tvOS because most devices are slower. Failing to maintain the target FPS in complex scenes may produce misleading GPU hang warnings.
    ([UUM-66493](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-framerate-drops-when-screen-is-touched-on-promotion-devices))

- Kepler: Icon setting is exported to manifest.

- Shadergraph: Added a new *Shader Graph UGUI Shaders* sample content set to the Shader Graph package. This sample demonstrates how to use the new Canvas target in Shader Graph to create dynamic UI elements. You can import this sample from the *Samples* tab in the Package Manager after selecting the Shader Graph package.

- SRP Core: Added an API to query the preferred depth-only format for target platforms.

- Text: Improved the performance of Auto Text Generation \(ATG\) by implementing multithreading for generating multiple TextElement objects.

- URP: Implemented minor CPU optimizations for the Post-Processing Bloom effect.<br>
    Enhanced code quality by consistently using TextureDesc in place of RenderTextureDescriptor.



#### API Changes

- Android: Added: Added `AndroidExternalToolsSettings.gradleUserHomePath`, which you can use to set gradle home path.
    (UUM-92289)

- Package Manager: Obsoleted: Made the `IShouldIncludeInBuildCallback` interface and the `BuildUtilities.RegisterShouldIncludeInBuildCallback` API obsolete.

- Particles: Added: Added the `applyActiveColorSpace` property to `ParticleSystem`, `LineRenderer`, and `TrailRenderer`.

- Physics 2D: Added: Added the `Collider2D.CanContact` method, which checks if two colliders can ever come into contact.

- Physics 2D: Added: Added `Collider2D.contactMask` property, which calculates the effective `LayerMask`. This includes both the Layer Collision Matrix settings along with any Rigidbody2D and Collider2D layer overrides specified.

- Physics 2D: Added: Added `PolygonCollider2D.CreateFromSprite` which calculates new PolygonCollider2D paths from a specific Sprite as is done automatically when a PolygonCollider2D is first added.

- Physics 2D: Deprecated: Deprecated the `ContactFilter2D.NoFilter` method. Use the static property `ContactFilter2D.noFilter` instead.

- UI Toolkit: Added: Added support to reorder tabs, and to retrieve tabs and tab headers.



#### Changes

- Documentation: Review documentation about UniversalRenderer.CreateRenderGraphTexture.

- Editor: Editor: Improved RepositoryInfo API documentation.

- Editor: Editor: Improved Request\(Generic\) API documentation.

- Graphics: Updated R8G8B8A8 and B8G8R8A8 sRGB formats to report LoadStore as unsupported on Intel Macs. This change reflects that sRGB writes are explicitly not supported on these devices.
