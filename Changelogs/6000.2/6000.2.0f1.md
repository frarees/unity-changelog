- 2D: Disabled the instantiation of GameObjects from Tiles when the Tilemap is not attached to an enabled Grid to prevent performance issues from these GameObjects.
    ([UUM-110584](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/freeze-when-entering-play-mode-with-a-certain-tilemap-enabled))

- 2D: Reduced the recursive limit from 11 to 6 for instantiation of GameObjects from Tiles.

- 2D: Removed com.unity.2d.pixel-perfect package from 2D URP template because users should be using the PixelPerfect feature that comes with 2D URP.
    (UUM-95753)

- Android: Addded Android SDK 36 support.

- Android: Added `unity.agpVersion` to the gradle.properties file.

- Android: Enabled predictive back gesture support by default for new projects.

- Android: Updated x86_64 target architecture support. You can still use it, but this architecture might be removed in the future Unity versions.

- Asset Import: Improved the error message displayed when the Editor loses connection to an Asset Import Worker process.

- Bug Reporter: Updated the Bug Reporter UI to remove the small cross buttons at the end of each text input field.

- Build Pipeline: Enabled building AssetBundles with both the DisableTypeTree and StripUnityVersion flags. Fixed the ability to load these AssetBundles at runtime.
    ([UUM-102575](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-error-is-thrown-when-building-assetbundles-with-disablewritetypetree-and-stripunityversion-flags))

- Core: Added an error message to prevent the use of High Definition Render Pipeline \(HDRP\) compiler functions within the Universal Render Pipeline \(URP\) compiler.

- Editor: Improved synchronization between `activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged` and `activeRenderPipelineTypeChanged`. The `activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged` event is now always called before `activeRenderPipelineTypeChanged`.

- Editor: Improved the error message in the Editor to prevent Players from being built inside `PlayerLoop`.
    (UUM-90979)

- Editor: Renamed the *Diagnostics* section in the Preferences menu to *Editor Diagnostics*.

- Editor: The Game view rendering statistics window now displays a warning about incorrect triangle and vertex counts when indirect draw calls are issued, such as GPU Occlusion Culling.
    ([UUM-102572](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/statistics-window-shows-incorrect-information-when-gpu-resident-drawer-and-gpu-occlusion-culling-are-enabled))

- EmbeddedLinux: Removed unused LGPL libusb code from SDL.

- Graphics: Deprecated the ETC legacy compressor.

- Graphics: Updated R8G8B8A8 and B8G8R8A8 sRGB formats to report LoadStore as unsupported on Intel Macs. This change reflects that sRGB writes are explicitly not supported on these devices.
    (UUM-95478)

- HDRP: Corrected the displayName value in the `package.json` file to match the official package name "High Definition Render Pipeline".

- HDRP: Rendering Debugger - Moved decals to the Rendering Section.

If you used the identifier identifier to store InstanceID data, upgrade your TreeViews to use `TreeView<InstanceID>` to get the proper typing.

- iOS: Modified the interface between the Trampoline and Unity Player for setting up backbuffer. The recommend best practice is not to modify the way the trampoline sets up the backbuffer, but if you do, please note that now we UnityViewSwapchain struct instead of passing whole UnityDisplaySurfaceMTL. Currently, the backward compatibility is preserved and we still UnityDisplaySurfaceMTL members that are related to drawables, but soon we will move it from this completely.

- Kepler: Updated the `onReconfigure` event to pass system values to its callbacks and delegates.

- Linux: Removed unused LGPL libusb code from SDL.

- Package Manager: Removed the `overrideBuiltIns` property making all `builtin` packages with semver version unable to be overridden.

- QNX: Removed unused LGPL libusb code from SDL.

- Scripting: Removed outdated `ApiUpdater` configurations that were causing issues.
    ([UUM-77628](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/script-updater-for-unity-dot-2d-dot-pixelperfect-dot-editor-dot-dll-failed-when-creating-a-new-project-in-unity-6000))

- SRP Core: Rendering Debugger - Moved the GPU Resident Drawer to the Rendering Section.
    ([UUM-92304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/consolidating-rendering-settings-in-the-rendering-debugger))

- UI Toolkit: Removed the *Project Setting &gt; UI Toolkit &gt; Enable World Space Rendering* setting because World Space support is now fully integrated and always available.

- Universal RP: Removed the `inputSummary.requiresColorTextureCreated` property in favor of using `scriptableRenderPass.requireIntermediateTexture`, which provides the same functionality.

- URP: Corrected the displayName value in the `package.json` file to match the official package name "Universal Render Pipeline".

- Version Control: Added dedicated toolbar buttons to open the list of branches and the Branch Explorer of the Desktop App.

- Version Control: Changed the changeset context menu item *Undo this change* to *Revert this file to the previous revision* to be more explicit.

- Version Control: Improved the Create workspace window to suggest the matching Unity Cloud project if it exists.
