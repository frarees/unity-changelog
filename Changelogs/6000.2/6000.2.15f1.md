### 6000.2.15f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- Documentation: Reformatted the documentation page for "Cubemap.CreateExternalTexture" and added missing information. Corrected expected pointer type for D3D12 on all "CreateExternalTexture" pages \(always "ID3D12Resource*"\). Minor polish pass on the page for "Texture3D.CreateExternalTexture", no actual changes in content outside of the mentioned D3D12 change.
    (UUM-119638)

- Editor: Improved interactivity of progress bar when opening the "Compile and Show Code" dropdown in the Shader Inspector.
    ([UUM-97524](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-time-and-the-number-of-shader-variants-highly-increase-when-using-a-lit-shader-graph-and-clicking-the-pop-up-menu-of-the-compile-and-show-code))



#### Fixes

- Android: On Android XR devices, fixed a hang in FMOD shutdown when calling Application.Quit\(\).
    (UUM-111037)

- DX12: Fixed for corruption in constant buffers on async compute queue.
    (UUM-127265)

- DX12: Fixed unrelated crash info that gets accumulated in the logs after a first GPU device crash. Now we shut down the app as early as possible after a DX12 crash, so that log messages, callstacks and DRED outputs are only relevant to the original GPU error.
    (UUM-128283)

- DX12: Fixed validation error \(state mismatch\) when setting a render target, then doing a resolve with it and then using that render target.
    (UUM-127199)

- DX12: Relaxed an error message when ending a subpass prematurely.
    (UUM-124900)

- Editor: Fixed a bug that was causing an exception in the console when asset bundles containing terrains created by an older version of Unity were loaded that contained instanced terrain details.
    (UUM-117177)

- Editor: Fixed an editor crash which occurring in projects using split native graphics jobs.
    ([UUM-126695](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-dynamicbranchstate-preparestate-when-idle-in-a-project-with-specific-shaders))

- Editor: Fixed bug: "Unity Services are not disabled and cause longer build times when the project is not connected to Unity Cloud".
    ([UUM-120502](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-services-are-not-disabled-and-cause-longer-build-times-when-the-project-is-not-connected-to-unity-cloud))

- Editor: Fixed random flickering outline around selected objects when using Umbra baked occlusion culling.
    ([UUM-107639](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobject-outline-flickers-when-selecting-it-and-setting-the-draw-mode-to-wireframe))

- Editor: Fixed Remove Unused Overrides menu item in hierarchy is now disabled when scene is not loaded.
    ([UUM-121931](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/remove-unused-overrides-available-on-not-loaded-scene-and-throws-argumentexception-the-scene-is-not-loaded-warning))

- GI: Fixed an issue where APV scenario blending is non-functional on MacOS.
    ([UUM-126723](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/adaptive-probe-lighting-scenarios-are-immutable-when-in-play-mode))

- Graphics: Fixed ComputeBuffer.GetData sometimes not waiting for gpu to finish.
    (UUM-122369)

- Graphics: Fixed Grabpass does not work when the Render Target is set to Camera and specific Viewport values are set \(0,0.5,0.5,0.5\).
    ([UUM-113033](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/grabpass-does-not-work-when-the-render-target-is-set-to-camera-and-specific-viewport-values-are-set-00-dot-50-dot-50-dot-5))

- Graphics: Fixed occasional crash when changing shader in the inspector to the one with GrabPass.
    ([UUM-121727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mono-dump-native-crash-info-when-changing-a-particle-system-renderers-material-shader-to-standard-unlit))

- Physics: Fixed a crash inside Rigidbody.Move which could occur when calling the method on a fully disabled body.
    ([UUM-126746](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-physx-scb-body-setkinematictarget-when-moving-disabled-parent-kinematic-rigidbody))

- Physics: Fixed a crash that would occur when adding a Cloth component to a GameObject with an existing TextMesh component. By default both Cloth and TextMesh components can't share the same GameObject due to the fact that they require different renderers to work, MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer respectively.
    ([UUM-125416](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-on-pptr-after-adding-text-mesh-and-cloth-components-to-the-same-gameobject))

- Plugins: Fixed a crash on DX11 when RenderDoc is enabled while NVIDIA package is added to the project.

    (UUM-127812)

- Shaders: Added word wrapping to the compute shader inspector kernel label field.
    ([UUM-126858](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vfx-compute-shader-inspector-fields-are-spaced-far-from-their-labels))

- Shaders: Fixed a "keyword space mismatch" error showing when accessing materials before they're fully initialized.
    (UUM-127035)

- Shaders: Fixed a temp memory leak for shaders with more than 128 keywords.
    ([UUM-120175](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-leaks-occur-when-shader-with-more-than-128-keywords-is-compiled))

- SRP Core: Prevent Missing Additional Camera warning when the project build.
    ([UUM-121897](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/camera-main-camera-does-not-contain-an-additional-camera-data-component-dot-warning-is-thrown-when-building-a-project))

- uGUI: Fixed for flickering caret and highlight while selecting text in a TextMeshPro InputField  while continuing to drag cursor above or below of the Input Field.
    ([UUM-122467](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/textmeshpro-text-inputs-caret-is-flickering-when-line-mode-is-set-to-multi-line-and-text-is-selected))

- URP: Removed warning wrongly thrown by project upgrader's indexer when method is not found in a worker thread.
    ([UUM-125463](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-to-birp-conversion-workflows-log-errors-in-log-and-in-console))

- URP: Save URP asset before starting an asset bundle build.
    ([UUM-126809](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-is-using-in-memory-assets-without-saving-them))
