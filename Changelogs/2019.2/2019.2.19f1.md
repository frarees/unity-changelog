*   iOS: Added support for iPad 7 generation. ([1196002](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-ios-dot-device-dot-generation-doesnt-contain-ipad-7th-generation))
    
*   iOS: Fixed a crash on CreateCppStringFromNSString when entering Emoji as max character. ([1198204](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-crash-on-createcppstringfromnsstring-when-entering-emoji-as-max-character))
    
*   iOS: Fixed an issue where the crash reporter would crash if Unity failed to initialize correctly. ([1145982](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-crash-on-lookup-core-basic-string-char-core-stringstoragedefault-at-hash-set-dot-h-645-49-during-unity-cleanup))
    
*   Mobile: Added iPod Touch 7th Generation to the iOS.DeviceGeneration API. ([1185468](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-seventh-generation-ipod-touch-is-not-recognized-using-device-dot-generation))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed crash caused by disposing of default-constructed TransformAccessArrays. ([1148324](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/transformaccessarray-dot-dispose-crashes-player))
    
*   Particles: Fixed crash when using scripted simulation on nested hierarchies due to threading race condition. ([1194538](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-crash-on-shapemodule-emitterstoremeshdata-colorrgba32))
    
*   Particles: Fixed particle crash due to uninitialized currentSize array. ([1197761](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particlesystem-dot-setparticles-crashes-the-editor-when-writing-particle-list-to-array-and-particle-system-has-a-size-module-enabled))
    
*   Particles: Fixed particle rendering when using cmd.DrawRendered and context.ExecuteCommandBuffer. ([1195214](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-is-not-rendered-in-the-game-window-when-using-cmd-dot-drawrendered-and-context-dot-executecommandbuffer-to-call-it))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed an issue where removed components on nested prefabs\\reappeared when applying subsequent modifications. ([1185746](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/aplying-changes-to-root-prefab-in-a-nested-prefab-undo-changes-made-to-the-child-prefab))
    
*   Scene Management: Fixed an issue to add prefabs to hierarchy in first position. ([1197793](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-is-childed-when-dragging-the-prefab-from-project-window-to-hierarchy-window-between-scene-tab-and-the-first-object))
    
*   Scene Management: Fixed an issue with dragging Prefabs into scenes during Play Mode where they were incorrectly instantiating them as editor Prefab instances. This would incorrectly impose editor Prefab instance restructuring restrictions on runtime logic. They are now instead instantiated using the runtime Object.Instantiate method in these cases. ([1166938](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefabs-dragged-into-scene-in-play-mode-are-not-unpacked))

*   Scripting Upgrade: No longer patch assembly references to UnityEngine module assemblies to point to the single UnityEngine instead, as this was causing too much trouble.
    
*   UI: Fixed an issue with nested canvases when using multiple display. ([1199299](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dropdown-list-is-not-aligned-with-the-dropdown-field-in-standalone-build-when-using-multiple-screens-with-different-resolutions))
    
*   Version Control: Fixed an issue with RevertTask crashing Unity when reverting unchanged scene. ([1202758](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/perforce-fatal-crash-when-using-provider-dot-revert-on-unchanged-scenes-and-reloading-scenes-at-the-same-time))
    
*   Version Control: Fixed an issue with RevertTask not reverting assets after rename while using PlasticSCM.
    
*   Video: fixed an issue where Asset bundles which included VideoClip have different CRC values when built from a different directory. ([1152507](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asset-bundles-which-include-videoclip-have-different-crc-values-when-built-from-a-different-directory))
    
*   WebGL: Disabled unnecessary default canvas event for "on drag" WebGL. ([1190839](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-mouse-input-is-blocked-after-a-few-moves-when-using-edge-browser))
    
*   WebRequest: Fixed an issue with UploadHandlerFile properties contentType and progress. ([1197177](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uploadhandlerfile-dot-contenttype-cannot-be-set-and-always-returns-text-slash-plain))
