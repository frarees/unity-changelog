#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   2D: Updated the 2D Project Template manifest.json to include 'com.unity.2d.sprite' and 'com.unity.2d.tilemap' as core packages.
    
*   Android: Android Gradle plugin version updated up to 3.4.

This often happens when importing Models with multiple Meshes or Materials that have the same name in the .fbx file. Their resulting file ID (and thus references to them) may break or change if Unity re-imports them and finds a new sub-Asset with the same name before finding the existing one.
    
*   Asset Import: Starting with the Unity 2019.3 release, you need an external plugin to import Cinema4D files directly in Unity. The External Tools forum provides updates: https://on.unity.com/c4d.

*   Graphics: Asynchronous Shader compilation: DrawProcedural now skips rendering during compilation instead of trying to use the dummy Shader.
    
*   Graphics: Moved the Async Shader Compilation option from Preferences to Project Settings.
    
*   Prefabs: Prefabs created by dragging into the hierarchy are now parents to the correct parent, instead of being a root object. The correct parent will thus be set in `Awake` calls.

*   Scripting: Recommended Visual Studio installer upgrade to version 2019
    
*   Timeline: Clip properties can no longer be animated by recording. Clip properties are animated with the Curves view.
