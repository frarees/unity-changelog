### Preview of Final 2019.2.0b1 Release Notes

#### System Requirements Changes

Nothing changed.

#### Features

*   2D: Added a Secondary Textures module to the Sprite Editor. You can use this module to associate additional Textures to the Aprites you're editing, and access those Textures in a Shader.
    
*   2D: Made the Sprite Editor Window available as a Package.
    
*   Android: Added Optimized Frame Pacing.
    
*   Android: Android App Bundles: Added AAB file size validation, so that Unity displays a warning message when the filesize is larger than the maximum size. You can disable this in the Android Player Settings (**Warn About App Bundle Size**) and adjust the maximum size (**App Bundle Size Threshold**).
    
*   Animation: Selection filter for the Animation Window. Only show properties and curves of selected GameObjects.
    
*   Editor: Added VSCode, Visual Studio, and Rider code editor integration as Packages.
    
*   Editor: Visual Studio (Windows): Updated behaviour so that when you double-click on C# compile messages in the console window, the corresponding C# file opens at the correct line and column, instead of only at the correct line.
    
*   Editor: Visual Studio Code: Updated behaviour so that when you double-click on C# compile messages in the console window, the corresponding C# file opens at the correct line and column, instead of only at the correct line.
    
*   GI: Added support for multiple importance sampling the environment to the GPU lightmapper.
    
*   GI: Added support for the cross-platform Intel lightmap denoiser, Intel Open Image Denoise. Intel Open Image Denoise can produce smooth noise-free lightmaps with few samples.
    
*   GI: Static Scene Dressing allows the user to choose whether GameObjects that contribute to Global Ilumination should receive GI from Light Probes or Lightmaps.
    
*   Graphics: Added SpeedTree support to the Scriptable Render Pipeline.
    
*   Graphics: Added support for all GPU formats for `RenderTexture` with Vulkan.
    
*   Graphics: Added support for partial mipmap chains in Texture classes.
    
*   iOS: Added client/worker multi-threaded rendering support for OpenGL ES 2 and 3.
    
*   Package Manager: - Added the ability to show/hide Packages in the Project Browser and Object Picker, depending on the Package type set in its manifest:
    
    *   If the Package type is `"tool"` or `"library"`, it is hidden by default; otherwise it is visible.
    *   If the Package manifest contains boolean attribute `"hideInEditor"`, this value overrides the visibility set by the Package type.
    *   Added a button in the Project Browser and Object Picker to toggle package visibility (include/exclude hidden packages).
    *   Added the Package `type` property and `hideInEditor` advanced property in the Package manifest Inspector.
*   Physics: Upgraded cloth library from deprecated PxCloth to NvCloth.
    
*   Scripting: Added support for Assembly Definition Reference (.asmref) files. These files allow you to add additional source code directories to an existing Assembly Definition File(.asmdef).
    
*   UI Elements: Added UIElements Samples window (Windows > UI > UIElements Samples). This window provides quick UIElements code snippets in the Editor.
    
*   VFX: Added core pieces to support MotionVectors in VFX Editor (preview Package).
    

#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   Editor: Changed default shortcut for "Stage/Go Back" from O to H to avoid shortcut conflict in project templates.
    
*   Editor: The legacy Module Manager has been mostly removed. Only extension modules located inside the Unity install will still be loaded now, and the 'Modules...' menu item and window has been removed completely.
    
*   Editor: UGui Objects are now using ObjectFactory and default Presets when created from the GameObject menu in the Editor.
    
*   Facebook: Added deprecation warning for Facebook Gameroom platform, which will cease to be supported in a future release.
    
*   Graphics: Async shader compilation: Blit now never uses cyan dummy shader.
    
*   Graphics: Async shader compilation: DrawProcedural skips rendering during compilation instead of trying to use dummy shader.
    
*   Graphics: Moved the async shader compilation option from preferences to project settings.
    
*   Graphics: Support graphics API switching by restarting Unity.
    
*   Graphics: When using SRP, added Rendering Layer Mask to Lights as a filtering option during shadow passes (similar to Renderers Rendering Layer Masks).
    
*   Prefabs: Prefabs created by dragging into the hierarchy are now parents to the correct parent, instead of being a root object. The correct parent will thus be set in `Awake` calls.
    
*   Scripting: Make the GarbageCollector.GCMode property only throw an exception on unsupported platforms when trying to change it's value, not when reading it.
    
*   Timeline: Changed Track Context Menu to show "Add Signal Emitter" at the top of the list of Marker commands. (1131166)
    
*   Timeline: Clip properties are no longer animated by recording. They are now animated using the inline curves.

    *   TerrainAPI.TerrainCallbacks.textureChanged These callbacks tell both the rect region being changed and if the change is CPU synchronized or not (i.e. GPU only).

*   Terrain: Added `TerrainData.SetTerrainLayersRegisterUndo` for setting the terrainLayers property and can be correctly undone if splat textures are created or destroyed during the process.
