#### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   2D: Updated the 2D Project Template manifest.json to include 'com.unity.2d.sprite' and 'com.unity.2d.tilemap' as core packages.
    
*   Android: Android Gradle plugin version updated up to 3.4

*   Asset Import: Added a warning when multiple sub-assets are imported with the same name/type. This often happen in the ModelImporter when multiple meshes or material have the same name in the .fbx file. Their resulting fileID (and thus references to them) may break/change if a new sub-asset witht he same name is found before the existing one after a re-import.
    
*   Asset Import: Starting with the Unity 2019.3 release, direct import of Cinema4D files will require an external plugin. Keep an eye on our External Tools forum for updates: https://on.unity.com/c4d.

*   Graphics: Asynchronous Shader compilation: Blit now never uses cyan dummy Shader.
    
*   Graphics: Asynchronous Shader compilation: DrawProcedural now skips rendering during compilation instead of trying to use the dummy Shader.
    
*   Graphics: Moved the Async Shader Compilation option from Preferences to Project Settings.
    
*   Prefabs: Prefabs created by dragging into the hierarchy are now parents to the correct parent, instead of being a root object. The correct parent will thus be set in `Awake` calls.
    
*   Scripting: Made the `GarbageCollector.GCMode` property only throw an exception on unsupported platforms when trying to change it's value, not when reading it.
    
*   Scripting: Recommended Visual Studio installer upgrade to version 2019
    
*   Timeline: Clip properties are no longer animated by recording. They are now animated using the inline curves.
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.1.0.
    
*   XR: Moved Vuforia support to a package.
    
*   XR: Oculus (Standalone) and OpenVR (Standalone) package names have been changed to use (Desktop) instead of (Standalone).

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK
    

##### For running Unity games

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 12.04+, SteamOS+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.1 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support or Atom CPU; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
    
*   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities
