5.4.0b14 Release Notes (Delta Since b13)
----------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   After expand/collapse Unity Editor window looks corrupted. If you maximize/minimize/click on windows in Editor they'll return to normal state.
*   Crash in ::RenderGameViewCameras:: after overflowing Width or Height fields of the Game view resolution window
*   First launch of Unity on new computer doesn't create "~/Library/Unity/Packages" folder, blocking homescreen from loading. Second launch will fix the issue
*   GPU Instancing: Instancing might get broken under glcore if graphics jobs are enabled.
*   In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering.
*   On Windows with MSAA and Image Effects, game view can be rendered upside down.
*   RTP Terrain shader rendering is broken after upgrading project to 5.4
*   Shadows: Directional shadows will present shadow acnee when using a custom projection matrix and a very large frustum (20k+)
*   Unity crashes when calling various methods on TerrainData with boundary values
*   Using OpenVR + Vive + Outdated Oculus Utils = Crash. Users are advised to update their Oculus Utils.
*   VR: GearVR builds are not functional in this beta release, please use b13
*   VR: Image effects do not currently work with single pass rendering.
*   VR: Single-Pass-Stereo causes some lighting problems
*   VR: Some built-in shaders do not currently work with single pass rendering resulting in wrong transformations in right eye. Workaround is to manually include the shaders in your project.
*   \[GL\] \[Windows\] Unity crashes or hangs with no respond on moving and undocking tabs
*   \[iOS\]\[Metal\] Performance degradation in 5.4 with some custom shaders
*   \[OnWillRenderObject\] Offscreen rendering from within OnWillRenderObject breaks billboard particles

5.4.0b14 Release Notes (Full)
-----------------------------

### Features

*   Asset Import: Support importing models with more than 100,000 objects
*   GI: Light Probe Proxy Volumes  
    This component allows using more than one light probe sample for large dynamic objects (think large particle systems or important characters). This will sample probes into a 3D texture and use that in the shader.
    *   Requires shader model 4 (DX11+/PS4/XB1/GLCore).
*   GI: Occlusion of the strongest mixed mode light is stored per light probe
*   Graphics: Added \[ImageEffectAllowedInSceneView\] attribute for Image Effects. This will copy the Image effect from the main camera onto the Scene View camera. This can be enabled / disabled in the Scene View effects menu.
*   Graphics: Basic GPU Instancing Support
    *   Use GPU instancing to draw a large amount of identical geometries with very few draw calls.
    *   Works with MeshRenderers that use the same material and the same mesh.
    *   Only needs a few changes to your shader to enable it for instancing. Supports both custom vertex/fragment shader and surface shader.
    *   Set per-instance shader properties from script via MaterialPropertyBlock.
    *   Supports Graphics.DrawMesh command.
    *   Supports Windows DX11/DX12 with SM 4.0 and up, OpenGL 4.1 and up on Windows/OSX/Linux.
*   Graphics: Fast texture copies via Graphics.CopyTexture.
*   Graphics: Graphics jobs can now be enabled (see player settings) for a potential performance boost. Currently in experimental status due to unknown project-dependent side effects.
*   Graphics: Texture Array support, seeTexture2DArray class.
*   IAP: Added support for fetching IAP products incrementally in batches.
    *   FetchAdditionalProducts method added to IStoreController
*   IAP: Cloud catalog support  
    A 'useCloudCatalog' boolean has been added to UnityEngine.Purchasing.ConfigurationBuilder. When set, Unity IAP will fetch your catalog of products for sale from the Unity cloud. Catalog is configured via the Unity Analytics dashboard.
*   iOS: Add URL schemes player setting
*   Kernel: The transform component has been rewritten using SIMD and a cache friendly data layout, the code is simpler and faster. As a result Transform.Setparent for large hieararchies can also be more expensive since all data for one hiearchy will always be tightly packed together.
*   OSX: Editor enabled retina support (text and some icons only)
*   Particles: Define particle width and height separately
*   Particles: Trigger Module
*   Physics: Expose ContactPoint.separation
*   Physics: Implement Physics.OverlapCapsule & Physics.OverlapCapsuleNonAlloc
*   Physics: Overlap recovery, used to depenetrate CharacterControllers from static objects when an overlap is detected. When activated, the CharacterController module will automatically try to resolve the penetration, and move the CharacterController to a safe place where it does not overlap other objects anymore.
*   Physics: Skip running the PhysX simulation step if not required by Rigidbodies or WheelColliders
*   Shaders: Uniform array support
    *   Uniform arrays can be set by new array APIs on MaterialPropertyBlock.
    *   The size of an array is lifted to 1023.
    *   The old way of setting array elements by using number-suffixed names is deprecated.
*   Substance: Substance: ProceduralMaterials are now supported at runtime on Windows Store/Phone platforms
*   VR: Native OpenVR support added
    *   Note that native OpenVR support renders with an off-center asymmetric projection matrix. This means that any shaders which relied on fov / aspect may not work correctly.
*   VR: Optimized Single-Pass Stereo Rendering available in Player settings
*   VR: VR Focus and ShouldQuit Support -Application Focus is now controlled by respective VR SDK when Virtual Reality Support is enabled. -Application will quit if the respective VR SDK tells the app to quit when Virtual Reality Support is enabled
*   VR: VR Multi Device Support
    *   PlayerSettings: When the Virtual Reality Supported checkbox is checked, a prioritized list is shown allowing devs to choose which VR SDKs their game supports. (Similar to the Graphics API selection dialog)
    *   VR SDK list is per build-target.
    *   Dependencies (dlls, etc) will be copied to the build for every sdk in the list.
    *   At startup, we’ll go down the list and try to initialize each device. If any fail to initialize (headset not connected, etc), we’ll move on to the next. If all fail, we won’t enter VR mode.
    *   PlayerSettings: Deprecate PlayerSettings’ stereoscopic 3d checkbox. This goes through the same subsystem as the VR devices, so a non-headmounted stereoscopic driver is one of the possible devices on supporting platforms.
    *   VR API: Deprecate VRDeviceType enum and VRSettings.loadedDevice. This is replaced with VRSettings.loadedDeviceName and VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName().
    *   VR API: Add the ability to get a list of supported sdks. Readonly: string\[\] VRSettings.supportedDevices
*   Web: WebPlayer support has been removed, and default player is the platform desktop being run on for the editor.
    *   Therefore desktop platform installation choices are removed as being part of their respective editors.
*   Windows: Added speech recognition APIs under UnityEngine.Windows.Speech. These APIs are supported on all windows platforms as long as they're running on Windows 10: Windows Editor, Windows Standalone and Windows Store
*   Windows: Windows Standalone player now can be run in Low Integrity Mode by passing -runWithLowIntegritylevel command line argument
*   Windows Store: Add command line argument -dontConnectAcceleratorEvent to disable accelerator event based input. This disables support for some keys in Unity (like F10, Shift), but fixes issue with duplicate characters in some XAML controls.
*   Windows Store: Realtime global illumination now works when using Windows 10 SDK
*   Windows Store: UnityWebRequest now supported for all SDKs

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   Android: WebCam no longer works on Gingerbread devices
*   Deployment Management: Any errors logged during the build process will now cause the build to fail. This includes errors that previously allowed the build to succeed anyway, such as shader compilation failures.
*   DX12: Introduced a new native plugin interface - IUnityGraphicsD3D12v2 . The old interface will not function anymore due to differences in internal graphics job submission.
*   Editor: Deprecated UnityEditor.ShaderUtil.ShaderPropertyTexDim; use Texture.dimension.
*   GI: Deprecated Light.actuallyLightmapped, use Light.isBaked and Light.bakedIndex instead. Baked Light got unique index, instead of the flag "actuallyLightmapped"
*   Graphics: Further deprecated Material(String) constructor - this will now always create a material with the error shader and print an error, in editor and player. It will be completely removed in a future Unity version.
*   Playables: refactored API so that Playables are struct instead of classes. Making the API allocation-less in c#.
*   Scripting: Added two new script errors in the editor for catching calls to the Unity API during serialization. See "Scripting Serialization" page in the manual for more details.
*   Scripting: To facilitate a memory optimization, UnityEngine.Object.GetInstanceID() is no longer thread safe.
*   Web: WebRequest interface was promoted from UnityEngine.Experimental.Networking to UnityEngine.Networking. Unity 5.2 and 5.3 projects that use UnityWebRequest will have to be updated.

### Changes

*   Android: Assets - Disable texture streaming for Android
*   Android: Removed native activity implementation. An activity with the same name based on a regular Activity is still in place for backwards compatibility reasons.
*   Android: UnityPlayerNativeActivity and UnityPlayerProxyActivity has been deprecated and will print warnings to the logcat if in use.
*   Audio: Streamed audio clips are no longer preloaded. This is done to reduce the number of open file handles in scenes referencing a large number of streamed clips. Except for a slight increase in playback latency the behaviour is not affected.
*   Audio: Updated FMOD to 4.44.56
*   DX12: Disabled client/worker mode as a preparation step for pure threading (-force-gfx-mt now does nothing for DX12).
*   DX12: Enabled GPU profiler in single-threaded mode (-force-gfx-direct).
*   Editor: Editor will warn opening a project from any version not matching the projects matching last version string saved in information. This means even 5.4.0b1 to 5.4.0b2, or 5.4.0f3 to 5.4.0p1
*   Particles: Added particle radius parameter for world collisions.
*   Physics: Fix for Character Controller Physics causing capsule to be thrown in the air when exiting another collider
*   Samsung TV: Added Ignore BG Alpha Clear checkbox to Resolution section of Samsung TV player settings. This will disable the clearing of the alpha value for the background fill allowing for blending between Unity's render layer and the layer behind.
*   Shaders: Internal shader for computing screenspace cascaded shadows was moved into Graphics Settings. If you were overriding it before by just dropping it into the project -- now need the custom one via Graphics Settings.
*   Shaders: Removed support for EXT\_shadow\_samplers on non-iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 platform. Almost no devices outside of iOS have it, so there's no point in having larger shaders for that.
*   Terrain: Now terrain objects created in the scene will be properly renamed to avoid using the same name.
*   Terrain: When different TerrainData are used for Terrain and TerrainCollider component on one GameObject, a warning message is shown and a button to help fix the situation.
*   UI: Switch component menu name for RectMask2D to match class name

### Improvements

*   Android: Added template for ProGuard obfuscation on exported project

*   Android: SoftInput - Get rid of hardcoded text color, switch to Light theme
*   Animation: Improved Animation event performance for repeat calls to the same events on components
*   Audio: Added virtualization of audio effects. For audio sources that are virtual because they have been culled due to low audibility or priority attached effect components or spatializers are now bypassed too in order to save CPU. The new behaviour is on by default but can be turned off in the audio project settings.
*   Audio: Audio clip waveform preview now displays the actual format used for compression when the default format isn’t available on a certain platform.
*   Audio: Fixed audio clip waveform preview rendering sync issues after import and improved the way the waveforms are being rendered to be more dynamic and reveal more detail.
*   Cache Server: Cache server: Improved the cache server so that it can properly handle scenarios when assets with missing references are being read.
*   Compute: Add DispatchIndirect function (similar to DrawProceduralIndirect - dispatching compute shader with parameters sourced from ComputeBuffer)
*   Compute: Improve error handling for compute shaders
*   Compute: Revamp API of hidden counters on ComputeBuffers to be more sane. Now optionally reset when bound, and can be explicitly set via SetCounterValue
*   Core: Add more profiling information to the PersistentManager
*   Core: Improved job execution. Spawn worker threads based on the number of logical processors instead of physical cores.
*   DX12: Introduced -force-d3d12-stablepowerstate command line parameter. Use it when profiling the GPU.
*   Editor: Added ability to hide the tetrahedron wireframe while editing light probe group.
*   Editor: Added cancel button to "Opening Visual Studio" progress dialog.
*   Editor: Added edit mode for light probe group to avoid accidental selection changes.
*   Editor: Always show the scene headers in the Hierarchy (also when only having one scene) to prevent confusion when loading and unloading scenes in play mode (scene headers was popping in and out). Also it makes it possible to see what scene is loaded in OSX fullscreen mode.
*   Editor: Fixed the title of the Script Execution Order inspector
*   Editor: In play mode the DontDestroyOnLoad scene will only be shown if it has game objects
*   GI: Added Lightmapping.realtimeGI and Lightmapping.bakedGI editor APIs

*   GI: Fixed a problem where we would always recompute Final Gather even if the result was in the cache.
*   GI: Improved mixing of realtime and baked shadows - removes shadow from the back-facing geometry, preserves bounce and contribution of other baked lights
*   GI: Store BakeEnlightenProbeSetJob results in hashed file to speed up rebaking of light probes.
*   GI: Upgraded to Enlighten 3.03
*   GI: Use HDR color picker for ambient color instead of color plus ambient intensity.
*   Graphics: Added a -window-mode command line argument to override full-screen behaviour. Options: exclusive, borderless.
    
*   Graphics: Added mechanism to tweak some unity shader defines per-platform per-shader-hardware-tier. Currently it is exposed only to scripts: see UnityEditor.Rendering namespace, specifically UnityEditor.Rendering.PlatformShaderSettings for tweakable settings and UnityEditor.Rendering.EditorGraphicsSettings for methods to get/set shader settings. Please note, that if settings are different for some tiers, shader variants for ALL tiers will be compiled, but duplicates will be still stripped from final build.
    
*   Graphics: Added TextureDimension enum, and Texture.dimension property.
*   Graphics: Allow setting a slice of 3D/2DArray as a render target (Graphics.SetRenderTarget depthSlice argument).
*   Graphics: LOD: Reduced render batch breaking overhead due to LOD fading.
*   Installer: Mac Download Assistant will write additional logs to ~/Library/Logs/Unity/DownloadAssistant.log

*   Physics: Allow point editing in Inspector for Edge/PolygonCollider2D.
*   Scripting: Added new yield instruction: WaitForSecondsRealtime.
*   Scripting: Improved SendMessage performance for repeat calls to the same message on components
*   Scripting: ScriptUpdater asks whether to automatically update once per project session (i.e, a different project gets open or unity is restarted)
*   Serialization: Serialization depth limit warning now prints the serialization hierarchy that triggered the warning
*   Shaders: #pragma target 3.5, 4.5, 4.6 are accepted.
    *   3.5 - minimum version for texture arrays (DX11 SM4.0+, GL3+, GLES3+, Metal)
    *   4.5 - minimum version for compute shaders (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.3+, GLES3.1+)
    *   4.6 - minimum version for tessellation (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.1+, GLES3.1AEP+)
*   Shaders: Added shader #pragma to allow easy/cheap variants of shaders across different tiers of hardware in the same renderer without needing keywords (e.g. iPhone 4 and iPhone 6, within gles)
*   Shaders: Improved game data build times with many complex shaders, especially when they were already compiled before.
*   StackTrace: Deprecated Application.stackTraceLogType, use Application.SetStackTraceLogType/GetStackTraceLogType instead.
*   StackTrace: For StacktraceLogtype.None only the message will be printed (without file name or line number).
*   StackTrace: You can now set stacktrace log type in PlayerSettings for various log types.
*   Standalones: Add -hideWindow command line option to launch standalone applications with window hidden.
*   UI: Added a new property AscentCalculationMode to TrueTypeFont importer to control how font ascent value is determined.

The following are changes and fixes to 5.4.0 features and regressions...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Changes

*   Graphics: Direct3D 12 window mode will follow the setting of Direct3D 11 window mode.
*   Graphics: GPU profiler will now always work with Direct3D 12, but Graphics Jobs will be disabled during capture.

### Improvements

*   IL2CPP: Reduce the binary size and build time for projects which make use of many C# attributes.
*   Scripting: Improve script serialization error messages for ScriptableObject
*   Windows Store: On IL2CPP scripting backend, Unity players is now shipped as DLLs rather than a static libraries. This significantly reduces platform support module installation size and decreases generated C++ code linking time.
