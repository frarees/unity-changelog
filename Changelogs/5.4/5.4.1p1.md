### Improvements

*   Android: Buildpipe - Added pre-build step that verifies the environment. Check Android device, SDK and JDK before compiling the project and the scripts.
*   GI: Added a tooltip in the editor for Light Probes option in Renderer inspectors.
*   GI: Light Probe Volume - fixed performance issue with LPPV when no Renderers are found in the same game object. Light Probe blending job is much faster now.
*   GI: Reflection Probes component: Added and updated tooltips.
*   Graphics: Slight optimisation of CommandBuffer.DrawMesh and CommandBuffer.DrawRenderer.
*   iOS: Added iPhone 7 and 7+ entries to the device enum.
*   iOS: Added PlayerSettings to specify microphone and camera usage description. Needed for iOS 10 / Xcode 8 compatibility.
*   iOS: Update Build and Run to work with Xcode 8.
*   VR - Updated Oculus plugin to version 1.8

### Changes

*   GI: Reflection Probes component - renamed "Probe Origin" to "Box Offset" and "Size" to "Box Size" in the UI.
