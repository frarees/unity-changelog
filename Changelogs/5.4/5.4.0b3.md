5.4.0b3 Release Notes (since Beta 2)
------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   Creating a scene from the Project Browser's 'Create' menu currently crashes Unity. Use the 'New Scene' option from the main menu instead.
*   Fallback from Deferred to Forward when rendering lightmapped objects with mixed-mode light - can be fixed by introduction of baked shadow mask for lightmapped objects
*   GPU Instancing: When drawing meshes with instancing shaders by Graphics.DrawMesh, Unity fails to render with correct mesh.
*   Legacy Animation: Changes to the lights in 5.3 have caused an issue so that it currently is not possible to animate lights using the Legacy animation system. Fix arrived in 5.3, and is being forward ported soon.
*   Saving a scene on OSX might throw the error in the console: "TLS Allocator ALLOC\_TEMP\_THREAD..". Happens only on OSX El Capitan (10.11.1). Doesn't happen on OSX 10.10;
*   WebPlayer build is not removed. Expect its removal in a future beta.
*   \[VR\] Missing shadows in VR mode players with Forward and Legacy Deferred rendering Error: Attempting to release RenderTexture that were not gotten as a temp buffer

### Features

*   Kernel: The transform component has been rewritten using SIMD and a cache friendly data layout, the code is simpler and faster. As a result Transform.Setparent for large hieararchies can also be more expensive since all data for one hiearchy will always be tightly packed together.
*   Particles: Define particle width and height separately
*   VR: VR Multi Device Support
    *   PlayerSettings: When the Virtual Reality Supported checkbox is checked, a prioritized list is shown allowing devs to choose which VR SDKs their game supports. (Similar to the Graphics API selection dialog)
    *   VR SDK list is per build-target.
    *   Dependencies (dlls, etc) will be copied to the build for every sdk in the list.
    *   At startup, we’ll go down the list and try to initialize each device. If any fail to initialize (headset not connected, etc), we’ll move on to the next. If all fail, we won’t enter VR mode.
    *   PlayerSettings: Deprecate PlayerSettings’ stereoscopic 3d checkbox. This goes through the same subsystem as the VR devices, so a non-headmounted stereoscopic driver is one of the possible devices on supporting platforms.
    *   VR API: Deprecate VRDeviceType enum and VRSettings.loadedDevice. This is replaced with VRSettings.loadedDeviceName and VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName().
    *   VR API: Add the ability to get a list of supported sdks. Readonly: string\[\] VRSettings.supportedDevices

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

*   IMGUI: Fixed InvalidOperationException is thrown on opening "select audio clip" pop up dialog AND added EditorGUI.DisabledScope to replace deprecated EditorGUI.\[Begin/End\]DisabledGroup()

### Changes

*   Graphics: Unity splashscreen replacement. Unform across platforms now and featuring a light and dark(pro only) style.
*   Windows Store: Deprecated PlayerSettings.WSA.enableLowLatencyPresentationAPI. It is now always enabled.

### Improvements

*   Editor - Other: ENABLE\_PROFILER now works correctly in Editor for runtime dll
*   Graphics: DX11: Unity drawing annotations correct appear on Windows Store platforms when using GPU debuggers
*   IL2CPP: Optimize method prologues for code size and incremental builds
*   Metal: Support multithreaded rendering on iOS and OSX Metal devices
*   Samsung TV: 2016 Samsung TVs are now supported.
