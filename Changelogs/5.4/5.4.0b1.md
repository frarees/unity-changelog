### System Requirements Changes

*   Webplayer no longer supported and will be removed
*   iOS will require 7.0 or higher (dropping 6.0)

### Known Issues

*   WebPlayer build is not yet removed. Expect its removal in a future beta.
*   GI: Fallback from Deferred to Forward when rendering lightmapped objects with mixed-mode lights. Will be fixed later by introduction of baked shadow mask for lightmapped objects.
*   GPU Instancing: When drawing meshes with instancing shaders by Graphics.DrawMesh, Unity fails to render with the correct mesh. Will be fixed in a future beta.
*   Legacy Animation: Changes to the lights in 5.3 have caused an issue so that it currently is not possible to animate lights using the Legacy animation system. We are aware of this and working on a fix. We will keep you all updated with the progress

### Feature

*   [2D: 9-Slice sprites](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XSzUbJm9dRir9k0CJt9OCKKh357WWDwU54zcZyukd3s/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1450485972824000&usg=AFQjCNGi7oqeI5fV0VuY-5F7PcSRp4LZ3Q).
*   GI: occlusion of the strongest mixed mode light is stored per light probe.
*   Gl: Light Probe Proxy Volumes. This component allows using more than one light probe sample for large dynamic objects (think large particle systems or important characters). This will sample probes into a 3D texture and use that in the shader. Requires shader model 4 (DX11+/PS4/XB1/GLCore).
*   Graphics: Basic GPU Instancing Support.
    *   Use GPU instancing to draw a large amount of identical geometries with very few draw calls.
    *   Works with MeshRenderers that use the same material and the same mesh.
    *   Only needs a few changes to your shader to enable it for instancing.
    *   Set per-instance shader properties from script via MaterialPropertyBlock.
    *   Supported on Windows DX11/DX12 with SM 4.0 and up. Other platforms will be supported later.
*   Graphics: Fast texture copies via Graphics.CopyTexture.
*   Graphics: Texture Array support, see Texture2DArray class.
*   IAP: Cloud catalog support. “useCloudCatalog” flag has been added to UnityEngine.Purchasing.ConfigurationBuilder. When set, Unity IAP will fetch your catalog of products for sale from the Unity cloud. Catalog is configured via the Unity Analytics dashboard.
*   OS X Editor: Retina support (text and some icons only).
*   Physics: Overlap recovery, used to depenetrate CharacterControllers from static objects when an overlap is detected. When activated, the CharacterController module will automatically try to resolve the penetration, and move the CharacterController to a safe place where it does not overlap other objects anymore.
*   Shader uniform array support. Uniform arrays can be set by new array APIs on MaterialPropertyBlock. Maximum array size is 1023. The old way of setting array elements by using number-suffixed names is deprecated.
*   Substance: ProceduralMaterials are now supported at runtime on Windows Store/Phone platforms.
*   Graphics: Support importing models with more than 100,000 objects.
*   Windows Store: Realtime global illumination now works when using Windows 10 SDK.
*   Windows Store: UnityWebRequest is now supported for all SDKs.

### Change

*   Android: Assets - Disable texture streaming for Android
*   Android: Removed native activity implementation. An activity with the same name based on a regular Activity is still in place for backwards compatibility reasons.
*   Android: UnityPlayerNativeActivity and UnityPlayerProxyActivity has been deprecated and will print warnings to the logcat if in use.
*   Android: WebCam no longer works on Gingerbread devices
*   Audio: Streamed audio clips are no longer preloaded. This is done to reduce the number of open file handles in scenes referencing a large number of streamed clips. Except for a slight increase in playback latency the behaviour is not affected.
*   Audio: Updated FMOD to 4.44.56
*   DX12: Disabled client/worker mode as a preparation step for pure threading (-force-gfx-mt now does nothing for DX12).
*   DX12: Enabled GPU profiler in single-threaded mode (-force-gfx-direct).
*   DX12: Introduced a new native plugin interface - IUnityGraphicsD3D12v2 . The old interface will not function anymore due to differences in internal graphics job submission.
*   Editor will warn opening a project from any version not matching the projects matching last version string saved in information. This means even 5.4.0b1 to 5.4.0b2, or 5.4.0f3 to 5.4.0p1
*   Editor: Deprecated UnityEditor.ShaderUtil.ShaderPropertyTexDim; use Texture.dimension.
*   Shaders: Further deprecated Material(String) constructor - this will now always create a material with the error shader and print an error, in editor and player. It will be completely removed in a future Unity version.
*   GI: Deprecated Light.actuallyLightmapped, use Light.isBaked and Light.bakedIndex instead. Baked Light got unique index, instead of the flag "actuallyLightmapped"
*   Physics: Fix for Character Controller Physics causing capsule to be thrown in the air when exiting another collider
*   Playable : refactored API so that Playables are struct instead of classes. Making the API allocation-less in c#.
*   Samsung TV: Added Ignore BG Alpha Clear checkbox to Resolution section of Samsung TV player settings. This will disable the clearing of the alpha value for the background fill allowing for blending between Unity's render layer and the layer behind.
*   Scripting: Added two new script errors in the editor for catching calls to the Unity API during serialization. See "Scripting Serialization" page in the manual for more details.
*   Shaders/Shadows: Internal shader for computing screenspace cascaded shadows was moved into Graphics Settings. If you were overriding it before by just dropping it into the project -- now need the custom one via Graphics Settings.
*   Shaders/Shadows: Removed support for EXT\_shadow\_samplers on non-iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 platform. Almost no devices outside of iOS have it, so there's no point in having larger shaders for that.
*   Terrain: New terrain objects created in the scene will be properly renamed instead of reusing the same default name.
*   Terrain: When different TerrainData are used for Terrain and TerrainCollider component on one GameObject, a warning message is shown and a button to fix the situation is provided.
*   To facilitate a memory optimization, UnityEngine.Object.GetInstanceID() is no longer thread safe.
*   UnityWebRequest: WebRequest interface was promoted from UnityEngine.Experimental.Networking to UnityEngine.Networking. Unity 5.2 and 5.3 projects that use UnityWebRequest will have to be updated.

### Improvement

*   2D: Added tessellation detail control to SpriteEditor
*   Added new yield instruction: WaitForSecondsRealtime.
*   Android: Added template for ProGuard obfuscation on exported project
*   Android: Application name now supports non-alphanumeric characters and spaces
*   Android: Converted some fatal error messages to be presented on screen rather than printed to the logcat
*   Android: Enhanced robustness of Location input
*   APIUpdater: ScriptUpdater asks whether to automatically update once per project session (i.e, a different project gets open or unity is restarted)
*   Audio: Added virtualization of audio effects. For audio sources that are virtual because they have been culled due to low audibility or priority attached effect components or spatializers are now bypassed too in order to save CPU. The new behaviour is on by default but can be turned off in the audio project settings.
*   Audio: Audio clip waveform preview now displays the actual format used for compression when the default format isn’t available on a certain platform.
*   Audio: Fixed audio clip waveform preview rendering sync issues after import and improved the way the waveforms are being rendered to be more dynamic and reveal more detail.
*   Compute: Add DispatchIndirect function (similar to DrawProceduralIndirect - dispatching compute shader with parameters sourced from ComputeBuffer)
*   Compute: Improve error handling for compute shaders
*   Compute: Revamp API of hidden counters on ComputeBuffers to be more sane. Now optionally reset when bound, and can be explicitly set via SetCounterValue
*   Core: Add more profiling information to the PersistentManager
*   Core: Improved job execution. Spawn worker threads based on the number of logical processors instead of physical cores.
*   DX12: Introduced -force-d3d12-stablepowerstate command line parameter. Use it when profiling the GPU.
*   Editor: Added a warning if there are still managed threads running after exiting play-mode. The editor only stops all managed play-mode threads when entering play-mode and recompiling scripts.
*   Editor: Always show the scene headers in the Hierarchy (also when only having one scene) to prevent confusion when loading and unloading scenes in play mode (scene headers was popping in and out). Also it makes it possible to see what scene is loaded in OSX fullscreen mode.
*   Editor: In play mode the DontDestroyOnLoad scene will only be shown if it has game objects
*   GI: Added Lightmapping.realtimeGI and Lightmapping.bakedGI editor APIs
*   GI: Atlassing would generate atlases with wasted space when scaling down objects.
*   GI: Fixed a problem where we would always recompute Final Gather even if the result was in the cache.
*   GI: Improved mixing of realtime and baked shadows - removes shadow from the back-facing geometry, preserves bounce and contribution of other baked lights
*   GI: Store BakeEnlightenProbeSetJob results in hashed file to speed up rebaking of light probes.
*   GI: Upgraded to Enlighten 3.03
*   GI: Use HDR color picker for ambient color instead of color plus ambient intensity.
*   Graphics: Added mechanism to tweak some unity shader defines per-platform per-shader-hardware-tier. Currently it is exposed only to scripts: see UnityEditor.Rendering namespace, specifically UnityEditor.Rendering.PlatformShaderSettings for tweakable settings and UnityEditor.Rendering.EditorGraphicsSettings for methods to get/set shader settings. Please note, that if settings are different for some tiers, shader variants for ALL tiers will be compiled, but duplicates will be still stripped from final build.
*   Graphics: Added TextureDimension enum, and Texture.dimension property.
*   Graphics: Allow setting a slice of 3D/2DArray as a render target (Graphics.SetRenderTarget depthSlice argument).
*   Graphics: Optimized the search for BuiltinShaderParamsNames.
*   iOS: Add URL schemes player setting.
*   Graphics: Reduced render batch breaking overhead due to LOD fading.
*   Mecanim: Improved Animation event performance for repeated calls to the same events.
*   Particles: Faster mesh data caching, plus memory usage optimization.
*   Physics: Allow point editing in Inspector for Edge/PolygonCollider2D.
*   Scripting: Improved SendMessage performance for repeat calls to the same message on components
*   Shaders: #pragma target 3.5, 4.5, 4.6 are accepted.
    *   3.5 - minimum version for texture arrays (DX11 SM4.0+, GL3+, GLES3+, Metal)
    *   4.5 - minimum version for compute shaders (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.3+, GLES3.1+)
    *   4.6 - minimum version for tessellation (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.1+, GLES3.1AEP+)
*   Shaders: Added shader #pragma hardware\_tier\_variants to allow easy/cheap variants of shaders across different tiers of hardware in the same renderer without needing keywords (e.g. iPhone 4 and iPhone 6, within gles).
*   StackTrace: You can now set stacktrace log type in PlayerSettings for various log types.
*   StackTrace: For StacktraceLogtype.None only the message will be printed (without file name or line number).
*   StackTrace: Deprecated Application.stackTraceLogType, use Application.SetStackTraceLogType/GetStackTraceLogType instead.
*   Windows Store: added bluetooth capability to player settings
*   Windows Store: UnityEngine.Ping now works on Windows Store..
*   Windows Store: in player settings visual asset images are now edited using object fields
*   Windows Store: System.operatingSystem will add '64 bit' postfix if target device has 64 bit CPU, more information in the docs.
*   Windows Store: PDBs will now be included in the installers for "Release" players too (debug and master players already had PDBs included)
