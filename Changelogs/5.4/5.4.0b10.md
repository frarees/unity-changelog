5.4.0b10 Release Notes
----------------------

### Known Issues

*   After expand/collapse Unity Editor window looks corrupted. If you maximize/minimize/click on windows in Editor they'll return to normal state.
*   Android: UI Input requires two touches to work
*   Crash in ::RenderGameViewCameras:: after overflowing Width or Height fields of the Game view resolution window
*   First launch of Unity on new computer doesn't create "~/Library/Unity/Packages" folder, blocking homescreen from loading. Second launch will fix the issue
*   GPU Instancing: Instancing might get broken under glcore if graphics jobs are enabled.
*   In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering.
*   On Windows with MSAA and Image Effects, game view can be rendered upside down.
*   Shadows: Directional shadows will present shadow acnee when using a custom projection matrix and a very large frustum (20k+)
*   Using OpenVR + Vive + Outdated Oculus Utils = Crash. Users are advised to update their Oculus Utils.
*   VR: Image effects do not currently work with single pass rendering.
*   VR: Single-Pass-Stereo causes some lighting problems
*   VR: Some built-in shaders do not currently work with single pass rendering resulting in wrong transformations in right eye. Workaround is to manually include the shaders in your project.
*   With Webplayer removal, desktop players are now part of their respective editor installations. Thus the option to separately install them is removed.
*   \[Billboard\]\[LOD\] Unity crashes when picking deleted Speedtree Billboard LOD level
*   \[IMGUI\]\[OSX\] Detached tab is not moved slightly with the cursor after opening project with changed layout in 5.4.

### Changes
