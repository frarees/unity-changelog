### Improvements

*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: It is no longer an error to use instanced shaders on renderers that don't support instancing (SkinnedMeshRenderer, SpriteRenderer, etc.)
*   Grpahics: GPU Instancing: For statically batched MeshRenderers, using instanced shader now will not break static batching. If you want renderers to be instancing batched, please consider disable static batching flag ([816786](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/static-batching-does-not-work)).
*   VR: Oculus GearVR version updated to 1.7.1.

### Fixes

*   ([820203](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-in-animation-createanimatorgenericbindings-when-attempting-to-use-animationmixerplayable-on-start-of-a-game-object)) - Animation: Fixed a crash in Animation::CreateAnimatorGenericBindings when attempting to use AnimationMixerPlayable on start of a game object.
*   ([822897](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/turning-of-resample-curves-in-additive-layers-changes-animation-movement)) - Animation: Fixed additive layer using disabled "Resample Animation" blended with layers that have it enabled.
*   (816567) - Editor: Fixed a bug that launching Editor window will exit after signed on windows.
*   (716213) - Editor: Fixed occasional freeze when profiling over network and connection is lost.
*   ([771779](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-crashes-in-generateshortcut-nsstring-star-on-start-up)) - Editor: Fixed crash caused by leading and/or trailing slahes in MenuItem names.
*   (798702, 810632) - Graphics: Fixed a couple of bugs in the CPUÂ mipmap generation (2D & 3D) for floating point texture formats: RHalf, RFloat, RGHalf, RGFloat, RGBAHalf, RGBAFloat.
*   ([819088](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/instanced-objects-are-rendered-wrong-when-two-directional-lights-with-important-render-mode-are-used)) - Graphics: Fixed a rare issue that results in incorrect instancing rendering when multiple lights are used.
*   (none) - Graphics: Fixed ForwardAdd pass z-fighting issue when the object is rendered with GPU instancing (for example when you have multiple lights).
    *   Surface shaders are automatically updated to apply the fix.
    *   For custom vert/frag shaders, instead of using the macro "UNITY\_USE\_CONCATENATED\_MATRICES", now please use the new "#pragma force\_concat\_matrices" directive in the ForwardAdd pass.
*   ([821418](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-string-dot-intern-is-extremely-slow-on-il2cpp-builds)) - IL2CPP: Fixed poor performance of string.Intern().
*   ([811511](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gl-dot-loadpixelmatrix-doesnt-work-in-vr-with-single-pass-stereo-rendering)) - VR: Fixed GL.LoadPixelMatrix() not working when Single-Pass Stereo was enabled.
*   ([811571](http://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vr-ambient-obsurance-plus-camera-motion-blur-is-broken-in-single-pass-stereo-rendering)) - VR: Updated the following Image Effects from the Standard Assets to work with Single-Pass Stereo; Ambient Obscurance, Camera Motion Blur.
