5.4.0b8 Release Notes
---------------------

### Known Issues

*   After expand/collapse Unity Editor window looks corrupted. If you maximize/minimize/click on windows in Editor they'll return to normal state.
*   GPU Instancing: Instancing might get broken under glcore if graphics jobs are enabled.
*   Graphics: with the new jobs enabled, reflection probes might render incorrectly in rare cases.
*   In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering.
*   On Windows with MSAA and Image Effects, game view can be rendered upside down
*   Shadows: Directional shadows will present shadow acnee when using a custom projection matrice and a very large frustum (20k+)
*   VR: Single-Pass-Stereo causes some lighting problems
*   \[Billboard\]\[LOD\] Unity crashes when picking deleted Speedtree Billboard LOD level
*   \[IMGUI\]\[OSX\]\[Regression\] Detached tab is not moved slightly with the cursor after opening project with changed layout in 5.4
*   \[Regression\]\[5.4\]\[RTP\] RTP Terrain shader rendering is broken after upgrading project to 5.4

### Improvements

*   Editor: Add api to toggle preventing cross-scene references on/off.
*   Editor: Discard changes' in scene context menu: Reloads selected modified scenes
*   GI: Improved light update performance
*   Multiplayer: Make matchName and matchSize serializable attributes so they can save on the network manager

*   Multiplayer: Explicitly Dispose() WWW object in MatchMaker callback handler when done with it.
*   Multiplayer: Fixed bug where connecting to a non https MatchMaker after joining 1 match would fail in all cases
*   Multiplayer: Fixed issue where an error response from the server could lead to undesirable console output in non error cases when setting the match auth token
*   Multiplayer: Fixed issue where default matchmaker port was 80 instead of 443 in 1 code path
*   Multiplayer: Fixed issue with matchSize being incorrectly used from a join match response
*   Multiplayer: Fixed UI panel on NetworkManager for match max size and name, as well as add in tooltip info for both
*   Multiplayer: Fixed up MatchMaker URI to be correct with http:// prefix as default
*   Plugins: Fixed Editor crash, when trying to set plugin settings for deprecated platforms.
*   Shaders: Fixed case of animated standard shader Emission being wrongly overriden by material inspector
*   Shadows: Fixed shadow error messages happening in some cases
*   Shadows: Fixed shadows disappearing for some off-screen shadows casters
*   Shadows: Prevent setting out-of-range shadow strength
