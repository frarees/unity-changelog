5.4.0b5 Release Notes
---------------------

### Known Issues

*   After expand/collapse Unity Editor window looks corrupted. If you maximize/minimize/click on windows in Editor they'll return to normal state.
*   Bug reporter crashes if it's opened from Finder/Explorer
*   Changing the active graphics API in the Editor while a Canvas is in the scene will crash the Editor. As a workaround, open only a new, empty scene before changing graphics API.
*   Crash of Standalone player when character with SkinnedMeshRenderer is on the scene
*   In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights will fallback to forward rendering. Plan to fix this in the future by introducing baked shadow masks.
*   Saving a scene on OSX might throw the error in the console: "TLS Allocator ALLOC\_TEMP\_THREAD..". Happens only on OSX El Capitan (10.11.1). Doesn't happen on OSX 10.10;
*   Shadows: Directional shadows will present shadow acnee when using a custom projection matrice and a very large frustum (20k+)
*   Unity crashes sometimes after deleting asset files from project folder
*   \[Billboard\]\[LOD\] Unity crashes when picking deleted Speedtree Billboard LOD level
*   \[GL\] \[Windows\] Unity crashes or hangs with no respond on moving and undocking tabs
*   \[MonoDevelop\] "..UnitTestTextEditorExtension not found.." error message appears when user open script in MonoDevelop
*   \[Skinning\] Skinning broken on Mac
*   \[Windows\]\[MT\] Unity crashes after mass placing SpeedTrees on terrain

### Features

*   Graphics: Added \[ImageEffectAllowedInSceneView\] attribute for Image Effects. This will copy the Image effect from the main camera onto the Scene View camera. This can be enabled / disabled in the Scene View effects menu.
*   VR: Optimized Single-Pass Stereo Rendering available in Player settings

### Improvements

*   Editor: Added EditorSceneManager.DetectCrossSceneReferences API
*   Scripting: Improved Instantiate() performance.
*   UI: Begin work on improving performance of MaskUtility functions
*   UI: UI now sets the texelSize for use in custom shaders
*   VisualStudio: Stop using COM to launch VisualStudio for a better immediate feedback experience
*   Windows Store: Improved deserialization performance when using .NET scripting backend

### Fixes

*   Editor: Fixed when dragging a second scene to Hierarchy the first scene would auto expand
*   GI: Fix fallback to non-directional lightmaps on SM2.0 hardware
*   Graphics: Fixed null reference exception being thrown when setting null to mesh triangles/indices
*   Graphics: Fixed problem of being able to set syncUploadBufferSize below 2 which leads application to crash on startup
*   MonoDevelop: Disabled Git, Subversion and NUnit add-ins by default. Fixes issue with being unable to write to newly created scripts
*   MonoDevelop: Fixed issue with MonoDevelop showing "��u" symbols in document view after using "Save As"
*   MonoDevelop: OSX: Fixed issue with MonoDevelop not working when copied to case-sensitive partition
*   MonoDevelop: Show hint in breakpoints dialog that explains exceptions list is generated from currently selected project
*   Scripting: GetTransform<>() invoked from a constructor or field initializer could crash Unity.
*   Shaders: Fix DX11 shader disassembly not showing correctly in the editor UI for 'show compiled code'.
*   UI: All struct value types now use iEquatable to prevent memory allocations
*   UI: Changed Canvas scaler to only scale the XY and not the Z of the transform
*   UI: Fix for 1/2 pixel offset not working on screen-space camera canvases
*   UI: Fix issue where setting canvas scaller to zero would cause a out of memory exception
*   UI: Fixed issue where text glyphs would be truncated if any texture filtering occured.
*   UI: Fixed issue where UnityEvent wouldn't allow the removeal of events after reload
*   UI: Fixed issue with Masking when enabling and disabling graphics
*   UI: If the mask is disabled we should use the baseMaterial instead of the masking material
*   UI: If the UI shader is not found the default "pink" shader will be used
*   UI: Make sure FontUpdateTracker get called for tracking fonts changed in the inspector
*   UI: Make sure InputEvents are sent when IME composition strings are updated in Windows Standalone.
*   UI: Prevent null list from geting passed as a parameter for VertexHelper functions
*   UI: Remove special case ascent calculation for non-dynamic fonts
*   UI: The UI batching grid size is not deterministic based on canvas/ element size.
*   UI: UI overlay canvas's will now always be drawn ontop in the scene view.
*   UI: Use GetRayIntersectionAll in Physics2DRaycaster to get more accurate results.
*   UI: When updating rectTransform data make sure comarisons are against old value not the set value
*   VR: Exposed Camera.targetEye to script for Virtual reality Applications.
*   VR: Fix Screen Orientation on GearVR applications.
*   VR: Fixed Splash Screen Aspect ratio issues for VR Applications.

The following are changes and fixes to 5.4.0 features and regressions...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Improvements

*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added #pragma instancing\_options for specifying instancing-specific options. Currently maxcount is the only option which allows the max batch size (i.e. the array size of the instanced properties) to be configured.
*   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Surface shader now supports instancing by simply adding #pragma multi\_compile\_instancing directive.

### Fixes

*   Analytics: Fixed Analytics fails to start on clean install
*   Animation: Fixed a bug where Light.m\_Enabled didn't animate properly when using AnimationComponent
*   Editor: Fix CaptureScreenshot in editor and screen-capturing for Unity Remote
*   Editor: Fix the issue that SceneManager.sceneCountInBuildSettings gives 0 until entering play mode
*   Editor: Fixed the issue that calling SceneManager.LoadScene\*\* while exiting playmode causes scene unremovable from the hierarchy
*   Editor: Make sure persistent transforms are not added to the active scene when running in a player. This could happen if a prefab is loaded from Resources
*   GI: Enlighten. Unity crashes if scene is unloaded before it gets a chance to fully load
*   Graphics: Fixed GPU Instancing now working with Graphics.DrawMesh.
*   iOS/IL2CPP: Prevent a managed exception on 64-bit builds during some array creation operations which has the message "ArgumentException: Destination array was not long enough. Check destIndex and length, and the array's lower bounds".
*   Profiler: Fixed missing Worker threads data from Timeline Profiler
*   Renderdoc: When making a RenderDoc capture from editor UI, make sure to include the whole frame including user script updates.
*   Shaders: During surface shader generation, do not initialise non-vector type members of the Input struct i.e. a struct/int/matrix as a member variable of the Input struct
*   Shaders: Fixed a shader compiler crash if a compute shader declares a samplerstate that doesn't match the naming scheme.
*   Shaders: When changing shader hardware tier emulation, only reload shaders (not textures/RTs) to stop refl probes breaking.
*   Shadows: Change light shadows near plane minimum bound to either 1% of range or 0.1, whichever is lower.
*   tvOS: Fixed Apple TV inclusion into Mac and Windows installer sets
*   Windows Store: Fixed a "MdilXapCompile failed" error when trying to build Visual Studio project for Windows Phone 8.1. This used to happen when the Unity game had over 8000 classes across all assemblies.
*   Windows Store: Fixed a crash which happened on "Windows N" versions when using IL2CPP scripting backend.
*   Windows Store: Fixed an issue which caused small tiles get copied to Visual Studio solution incorrectly for Windows Phone 8.1 SDK.
*   Windows Store: Fixed Application.Quit() when using D3D project type or IL2CPP scripting backend.
*   Windows Store: Fixed error "Task 'ExpandPriContent' failed." which occurred when trying to build an application package with IL2CPP scripting backend when using default Unity icons.
*   Windows Store: Fixed Visual studio graphics debugger crashing when trying to debug Windows Phone 8.1 projects.
