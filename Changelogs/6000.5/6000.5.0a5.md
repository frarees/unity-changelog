- Package Manager: Reduced information in the header and displayed them in cards in the Details and Overview tab.

- UI Toolkit: Added editor support for `VisualElementReference<T>`.

- Version Control: Added a cset by cset diff panel in the branches view.

#### API Changes

- Android: Added: Introduce AndroidJNI.DumpReferenceTables\(\) which can dump JNI references to logcat, enabling you to fix JNI leaks more easily.

- Editor: Added: Added the ability to add additional previousBuildMetadataLocations to build options from within the PrepareForBuild callback using the newly added BuildPlayerContext.AddAdditionalMetadataPathToPlayerOptions API.

- EmbeddedLinux: Added: Added IVI Surface ID setting through the Windowing API.

- Graph Toolkit: Added: Added new API `GetVariables(bool orderByDisplay)` to retrieve variables in the same order they appear in the blackboard.

### Preview of Final 6000.5.0a5 Release Notes

#### Features

- 2D: Added a 2D Profiler that displays real-time visualization of texture atlas usage whic offers clear insights into sprite and atlas efficiency during gameplay.

- Android: Insets visibility can now be controlled via Editor API/UI and Runtime API. Refer to `PlayerSettings.Android.requestedVisibleWindowInsets`, `PlayerSettings.Android.systemBarsBehavior`, `AndroidApplication.currentWindowInsets`, `AndroidApplication.onWindowInsetsChanged` to learn more.

- Build Pipeline: Added the ability to extract type tree data from asset bundles to reduce their size. This data can be loaded at runtime and shared between all bundles.

- Editor: Added tracking for UGUI usage.

- Editor: Changed the Texture Inspector's color channel previews to default to grayscale, and added a button to toggle between grayscale and colorized views.

- Editor: Project Auditor: Added a module/analyzer to inspect every GameObject in a project and flags issues about incorrect Read/Write Texture import settings, if used by Particle System Components.

- Editor: Project Auditor: asynchronous analysis.

- Editor: Updated Project Auditor to report the use of obsolete APIs.

- Editor: Updated the Build Profile window to automatically display a *Restart Unity Editor* option after a platform module is installed through the Unity Hub.

- Entities: `DisableAutoTypeRegistration` now is allowed assembly-wide.

- Graph Toolkit: Added support for the `TextArea` attribute to create multi-line text fields for ports and options.

- Graph Toolkit: Added the ability to create custom classes that inherit from `DataTypeStyleMapper` to associate icons and colors with custom data types. Custom `DataTypeStyleMapper` classes can be decorated with `DataTypeStyleMapperAttribute` to specify compatible graph types.

- Graph Toolkit: Updated the Constant node to support collections, such as lists and arrays. These collections can grow up to 50 elements and each element is editable directly from the node view.

- Graphics: Added an opt-in On-Tile Validation check on `UniversalRenderer`. Enabling it will enforce On-Tile optimization by issuing a warning and removing non-compatible features.

- iOS: Added a system that adjusts the frame rate based on the thermal state. When the device overheats, iOS enters Serious and then Critical thermal states. In the Critical state, iOS reduces system-wide performance to lower device temperature. With this new system Unity proactively lowers the frame rate to 30 FPS in Serious state and 15 FPS in Critical state, which helps prevent the device from becoming too hot, improves responsiveness under overheating conditions, and reduces the likelihood of GPU timeouts or rendering freezes. This feature is enabled by default and it can be toggled in the iOS Player Settings using the `Adjust iOS FPS based on thermal state` checkbox. In addition, the frame rate in the Serious state can be configured using `Serious Thermal State FPS`, and in the Critical state using `Critical Thermal State FPS`.

- Package Manager: Added a Locate button in the Package Manager to locate imported samples in the Project window.

- Package Manager: Reduced information in the header and displayed them in cards in the Details and Overview tab.

- Scripting: Added code coverage support for development builds on standalone platforms \(Windows, macOS, and Linux\) that use the Mono scripting backend.

- Serialization: Added a log message on Editor shutdown that displays the version of the oldest serialized file loaded during the session.

- Shaders: Added the `UNITY_PLATFORM_META_QUEST` preprocessor directive for shader compilation when targeting Meta Quest. This can be used to create platform-specific shader optimizations.

- UI Toolkit: Added a `PanelRenderer` component to UI Toolkit.
