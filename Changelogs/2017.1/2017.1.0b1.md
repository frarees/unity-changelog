2017.1.0b1 Release Notes (new since a6)
EDIT
---------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   Animation: Reading from Animator.rootPosition and Animator.rootRotation during OnAnimatorMove gives wrong results. Use Animator.deltaPosition and Animator.deltaRotation instead. (899049)
*   Audio: AudioSource attached to VideoPlayer produces choppy sound when playing certain mp4 files with VideoPlayer created from script (895458)
*   Editor: "The system cannot find file specified" error while opening the project for the first time. Deleting Library folder resolves the issue. (895343)
*   Editor: Editor crashes on attempt to open some 5.5 compatible audio projects. (880653)
*   Editor: Text in Editor becomes red after dismissing EditorUtility.DisplayDialog() popups. (886650)

### Features

*   2D: Added Sprite Physics Shape to Sprite Editor, to allow users to set a custom default shape for a Sprite for generating collider shapes with a PolygonCollider2D.
*   2D: Introduced 2D Sprite Atlas, a new asset that will supplant the Sprite Packer. With it comes new and improved workflows that gives the developer more control on how to pack sprites and use them at runtime.
*   2D: Sprite Mask. Mask Sprites in world space using the new SpriteMask component.
*   Animation: (Also mentioned under API changes) AnimationLayerMixerPlayable scripting API added.
*   Animation: Manual Keyframing Workflow. Separate Recording and Preview modes in the Animation Window. Contextual menus added to all animatable properties in the inspector.
*   Animation: New GameObjectRecorder in UnityEditor.Experimental.Animations
*   Asset Import: Added the option of computing weighted normals when importing FBX files. Fixed normal generation for hard edges.
*   Audio: Added support for ambisonic audio clips and ambisonic decoder plugins.
*   Build Pipeline: Added delegates to BuildPlayerWindow that allow overriding the default Build button behavior
*   Collab: In-Progress. In-Progress allows developers using Unity Collaborate to see who else on their team has made local changes to a Scene or Prefab before those changes have been published.
*   Editor: Added new ArcHandle class in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls to interactively edit arcs in the Scene View.
*   GI: Added new API for setting Light falloff per Light. Added API for setting all Lights to use physically correct inverse squared falloff or the Unity legacy falloff model. Only used for Enlighten lightmaps so far, realtime and progressive will be supported later.
*   Graphics: Added LineUtility class and 'LineRenderer.Simply' function. Optimize your lines and curves by using the LineUtility to create a simplified version with a similar shape.
*   Graphics: Added memoryless mode to RenderTexture, accessed through new property RenderTexture.memorylessMode.
*   Graphics: Added Mirror and MirrorOnce texture wrapping modes, in addition to existing Repeat and Clamp ones.
*   Graphics: Unity can now accept and use a pointer to an externally created cubemap
*   IL2CPP: Unity in-app purchase now works on Windows Store with the IL2CPP scripting backend.
*   IMGUI: Added SearchField, a new IMGUI Control. It comes with Normal and Toolbar UI styles but can also be customized.
*   iOS: (Also mentioned under API Changes) Added API to change iOS splashscreens.
*   iOS: Enable deferred shading rendering path for Metal and OpenGL ES 3.0 for A8 and later iOS devices.
*   Particles: Added support for using Sprites in the Particle System, via the Texture Sheet Animation Module
*   Particles: Align Particles to their velocity direction
*   Particles: Particles can now apply forces to the Colliders they hit
*   Physics: Added 'Joint2D.attachedRigidbody' property to retrieve the Rigidbody2D attached to the Joint2D.
*   Physics: When setting 'Rigidbody2D.simulated' to false, Editor inspector shows information about its effect.
*   Playables: Playable Assets added to Playable API.
*   Playables: Playable Director added to play Playable Assets
*   Playables: Timeline Editor and Runtime API. A tool for sequencing animation, scripts and audio.
*   Shaders: Added support for "inline" sampler states.
    *   HLSL SamplerState objects that aren't taking sampling state from any texture (like what "sampler"+TextureName samplers do), but where sampling state is instead derived from the name.
    *   For example, "MyLinearClampSampler" sets up bilinear filtering and clamp wrap mode; while "point\_repeat\_sampler" sets up point filtering and repeat wrap mode.
    *   This allows e.g. doing both PCF depth comparison and reading raw depth value from a shadow map in a single shader.
    *   Note that generally only modern graphics APIs support separate textures & samplers. You might therefore want to specify #pragma target 3.5 or similar in your shaders for this.
    *   Implemented on DX11, DX12, PS4, XB1, Metal (Vulkan not yet).
*   Windows: Multi-display support for UWP.

### Changes

*   Asset Import: Upgraded FBX SDK to 2016.1.2
*   Build Pipeline: Added new function SwitchActiveBuildTargetAsync. This defers switching so that scripts can be imported first.
*   Build Pipeline: Event EditorBuildSettings.activeBuildTargetChanged has been deprecated as events do not survive script reloading. Replaced with interface class IActiveBuildTargetChanged and attribute ActiveBuildTargetChanged.
*   Editor: Added new GameObject sub menu - 'GameObject/Effects/. This menu includes a Line andTrail creation. The particle system has also been moved to this menu.
*   Editor: Added requirement for Visual C++ Runtime 2013 and 2015 to be installed when installing Windows Editor (i.e. the check is performed by Windows Editor installer).
*   Editor: AssetServer version control support has been removed from the editor.
*   Editor: Moved particle system rigidbody info message to top of the system as it does not just apply to inherit velocity
*   Editor: New projects now default to text-based serialization
*   Editor: Particle trail material slot is now always visible even if it is not used.
*   OSX: Disabled Metal on macOS 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 for stability reasons if GLCore is also present in API list
*   Windows Store: DX11 feature level 9.3 GPU support is required now. In practice this probably does not affect anything, as all Windows Phones that ever existed support 9.3 level already.

### Improvements

*   Android: Apk files are now signed using the new APK Signature Scheme v2.
*   Asset Import: Changing tabs in the Model Importer inspector does not force users to apply changes anymore
*   Asset Import: Support Segment Scale Compensate for models exported from Maya.

*   Build Pipeline: Scripts-only build is now available on all platforms.
*   Build Pipeline: Unified assembly stripping code used for IL2CPP and Mono builds - which should result in more consistent behaviour between IL2CPP and Mono and in smaller build sizes for platforms supporting assembly stripping on Mono.
*   Editor: Added "Called From" and "Calls To" view to the Hiverarchy View of Profiler Window.
*   Editor: Added a pre-drop style to particle system Object fields so it highlights if something can be dropped.

*   Graphics: Added new default material for trails. 'Default-Trail'
*   Graphics: Frame Debugger is now capable of showing array shader properties.
*   Graphics: Optimized conversions between float32 and float16 image formats on Editor for a x2 to x4 performance improvement.
*   Graphics: Texture wrapping modes can be set separately on each U,V,W axis.
*   Graphics: The default names for Graphics Quality Levels have been changed to be a little clearer, and more in line with what is common across other games. This will only affect newly created projects; existing projects will have the same Quality Level names as before (though, as always, you can edit the names via Edit -> Project Settings -> Quality).
*   IL2CPP: Improved IL2CPP code conversion time on OSX. Conversion times may improve by as much as 2x.
*   iOS: Added support for Watch apps and Watch app extensions in the Xcode extension API.
*   Mobile: Added TouchScreenKeyboardType.Social and TouchScreenKeyboardType.Search for iOS/tvOS, Android, WindowsPhone and Tizen platforms.

*   Shaders: SystemInfo.graphicsShaderLevel now reports more accurate shader models that better match shader #pragma target levels (now can report values 25, 35, 45, 46).
*   Web: (Also mentioned under API Changes) UnityWebRequest now has built-in support for downloading MovieTexture on platforms that do support it. A new helper class WebRequestMultimedia has been introduced for simple download of MovieTexture or AudioClip. WebRequest.GetAudioClip() has been deprecated in favor of WebRequestMultimedia.GetAudioClip().

### API Changes

*   Animation: (Also mentioned under Features) AnimationLayerMixerPlayable scripting API added.
*   iOS: (Also mentioned under Features) Added API to change iOS splashscreens.
*   Playables: Moved Playable out of Experimental namespace.
