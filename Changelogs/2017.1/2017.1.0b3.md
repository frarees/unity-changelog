2017.1.0b3 Release Notes (Delta since b2)
-----------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   Audio: AudioSource attached to VideoPlayer produces choppy sound when playing certain mp4 files with VideoPlayer created from script (895458)
*   Editor: "The system cannot find file specified" error while opening the project for the first time. Deleting Library folder resolves the issue. (895343)
*   Editor: Editor crashes on attempt to open some 5.5 compatible audio projects. (880653)
*   Editor: Text in Editor becomes red after dismissing EditorUtility.DisplayDialog() popups. (886650)
*   Editor: Unity crashes when playing a scene with maximized game view (894572)
*   Graphics: Debug GFX overlay is drawn on top of objects. (851379)
*   VR: Rendering problems on Pixel Daydream when using 4x or 8x MSAA with single-pass stereo. This is due to driver issues, so the problem will be addressed via a driver update, independently of Unity releases. (-)

### Features

*   Collab: Project Browser Filters including 'All Modified', 'All Excluded', 'All Conflicts', 'All In Progress'
*   Collab: Right Click Menu Options in the Project Browser including See Differences, Revert, Conflict Resolution
*   Editor: MacOS: Support Visual Studio for Mac as an External Script Editor. Opens .sln (solution) file when double clicking a script.
*   Graphics: Added RenderTextureDescriptor struct that allows you to copy and create RenderTextures by passing a single value.

### Improvements

*   Editor: Simplify dragging code setup: Getting rid of the requirement of setting DragAndDrop.objectReferences = new UnityEngine.Object\[\] {} when using DragAndDrop.SetGenericData()
*   Web: It is now allowed to override User-Agent header in UnityWebRequest

### API Changes

*   Asset Import: Added ModelImporter.extraUserProperties
*   Playables: - Changed C# Playable classes to structures: new and better approach for the API, it uses less memory and is in line with the future job system.
    *   Remove properties in favor of getters and setters: since we're using class extensions that can't have properties, we decided to only use methods to have a consistant API (i.e. not properties there and methods here just because reasons).
    *   Rename ScriptPlayableData to PlayableBehaviour: the PlayableBehaviour is the user side of the ScriptPlayable, it is where the user puts its logic.
    *   Documentation is in progress expect a better one in a few weeks.

### Features

*   2D: Added Sprite Physics Shape to Sprite Editor, to allow users to set a custom default shape for a Sprite for generating collider shapes with a PolygonCollider2D.
*   2D: Introduced 2D Sprite Atlas, a new asset that will supplant the Sprite Packer. With it comes new and improved workflows that gives the developer more control on how to pack sprites and use them at runtime.
*   2D: Sprite Mask. Mask Sprites in world space using the new SpriteMask component.
*   Animation: (Also mentioned under API changes) AnimationLayerMixerPlayable scripting API added.
*   Animation: Manual Keyframing Workflow. Separate Recording and Preview modes in the Animation Window. Contextual menus added to all animatable properties in the inspector.
*   Animation: New GameObjectRecorder in UnityEditor.Experimental.Animations
*   Asset Import: Added ability to import visibility from FBX files to ModelImporter
*   Asset Import: Added the option of computing weighted normals when importing FBX files. Fixed normal generation for hard edges.
*   Audio: Added support for ambisonic audio clips and ambisonic decoder plugins.
*   Audio: Timeline Editor Audio Track support. Audio clips are now enabled in Timeline, using a scheduling API.
*   Build Pipeline: Added delegates to BuildPlayerWindow that allow overriding the default Build button behavior
*   Collab: In-Progress. In-Progress allows developers using Unity Collaborate to see who else on their team has made local changes to a Scene or Prefab before those changes have been published.
*   Collab: Project Browser Filters including 'All Modified', 'All Excluded', 'All Conflicts', 'All In Progress'
*   Collab: Right Click Menu Options in the Project Browser including See Differences, Revert, Conflict Resolution
*   Editor: Added new ArcHandle class in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls to interactively edit arcs in the Scene View.
*   Editor: Experimental feature : retained-mode UI system for the Editor (UIElements)
*   Editor: MacOS: Support Visual Studio for Mac as an External Script Editor. Opens .sln (solution) file when double clicking a script.
*   GI: Added new API for setting Light falloff per Light. Added API for setting all Lights to use physically correct inverse squared falloff or the Unity legacy falloff model. Only used for Enlighten lightmaps so far, realtime and progressive will be supported later.
*   Graphics: Added LineUtility class and 'LineRenderer.Simply' function. Optimize your lines and curves by using the LineUtility to create a simplified version with a similar shape.
*   Graphics: Added memoryless mode to RenderTexture, accessed through new property RenderTexture.memorylessMode.
*   Graphics: Added Mirror and MirrorOnce texture wrapping modes, in addition to existing Repeat and Clamp ones.
*   Graphics: Added RenderTextureDescriptor struct that allows you to copy and create RenderTextures by passing a single value.
*   Graphics: Unity can now accept and use a pointer to an externally created cubemap
*   IL2CPP: Unity in-app purchase now works on Windows Store with the IL2CPP scripting backend.
*   IMGUI: Added SearchField, a new IMGUI Control. It comes with Normal and Toolbar UI styles but can also be customized.
*   iOS: (Also mentioned under API Changes) Added API to change iOS splashscreens.
*   iOS: Enable deferred shading rendering path for Metal and OpenGL ES 3.0 for A8 and later iOS devices.
*   Particles: Added support for using Sprites in the Particle System, via the Texture Sheet Animation Module
*   Particles: Align Particles to their velocity direction
*   Particles: Apply Noise Module data to particles sizes and rotations, and also send the noise data to your shaders via new Custom Vertex Streams.
*   Particles: Mesh particles now support the same Render Alignment options are billboarded particles
*   Particles: New Donut emission shape.
*   Particles: Particles can now apply forces to the Colliders they hit
*   Particles: Play Particle Systems when your game is paused, by choosing to use either Scaled or Unscaled time for the simulation.
*   Particles: The Shape Module now contains an additional Transform, for applying custom transformations to the emitter shape.
*   Physics: Add ability to manully simulate 2D physics using "Physics2D.Simulate(time)" and turn auto simulation on/off with "Physics2D.autoSimulation=true/false".
*   Physics: Added 'Joint2D.attachedRigidbody' property to retrieve the Rigidbody2D attached to the Joint2D.
*   Physics: Expose Physics.Simulate and Physics.autoSimulation. This allows stepping the physics simulation manually, from scripts. Useful for customising the server-side physics, in-editor simulation, and more.
*   Physics: Exposed Joint.massScale & Joint.connectedMassScale. This allows adjusting masses and inertia tensors of the connected bodies as perceived by the solver. It's mostly useful for ragdolls that have high forces applied to their limbs and thus experiencing unpleasant stretchiness. This should also help avoiding setting the same mass for all the body parts of a ragdoll, as recommended before. See more in the API docs.
*   Physics: When setting 'Rigidbody2D.simulated' to false, Editor inspector shows information about its effect.
*   Playables: Playable Assets added to Playable API.
*   Playables: Playable Director added to play Playable Assets
*   Playables: Timeline Editor and Runtime API. A tool for sequencing animation, scripts and audio.
*   Shaders: Added support for "inline" sampler states.
    *   HLSL SamplerState objects that aren't taking sampling state from any texture (like what "sampler"+TextureName samplers do), but where sampling state is instead derived from the name.
    *   For example, "MyLinearClampSampler" sets up bilinear filtering and clamp wrap mode; while "point\_repeat\_sampler" sets up point filtering and repeat wrap mode.
    *   This allows e.g. doing both PCF depth comparison and reading raw depth value from a shadow map in a single shader.
    *   Note that generally only modern graphics APIs support separate textures & samplers. You might therefore want to specify #pragma target 3.5 or similar in your shaders for this.
    *   Implemented on DX11, DX12, PS4, XB1, Metal (Vulkan not yet).
*   Web: A new UnityWebRequest.timeout property that gives the user some coarse-grain control over the time a webrequest can take before unity attempts to cancel it.
*   Windows: Multi-display support for UWP.

*   VR: Updated Google NDK for Android and iOS to 1.40
*   Windows: "Visible In Background" player setting now defaults to on.
*   Windows: Renamed "Windows Store" to "Universal Windows Platform" in the build window
*   Windows Store: DX11 feature level 9.3 GPU support is required now. In practice this probably does not affect anything, as all Windows Phones that ever existed support 9.3 level already.
*   Windows Store: Removed support for building Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 applications.
