2017.1.0b4 Release Notes (Diff from b3)
---------------------------------------

### Known Issues

*   Audio: AudioSource attached to VideoPlayer produces choppy sound when playing certain mp4 files with VideoPlayer created from script (895458)
*   Editor: "The system cannot find file specified" error while opening the project for the first time. Deleting Library folder resolves the issue. (895343)

### Features

*   2D: Added Sprite Physics Shape to Sprite Editor, to allow users to set a custom default shape for a Sprite for generating collider shapes with a PolygonCollider2D.
*   2D: Introduced 2D Sprite Atlas, a new asset that will supplant the Sprite Packer. With it comes new and improved workflows that gives the developer more control on how to pack sprites and use them at runtime.
*   2D: Sprite Mask. Mask Sprites in world space using the new SpriteMask component.
*   Animation: (Also mentioned under API changes) AnimationLayerMixerPlayable scripting API added.
*   Animation: Manual Keyframing Workflow. Separate Recording and Preview modes in the Animation Window. Contextual menus added to all animatable properties in the inspector.
*   Animation: New GameObjectRecorder in UnityEditor.Experimental.Animations
*   Asset Import: Added ability to import visibility from FBX files to ModelImporter
*   Asset Import: Added the option of computing weighted normals when importing FBX files. Fixed normal generation for hard edges.
*   Audio: Added support for ambisonic audio clips and ambisonic decoder plugins.
*   Audio: Timeline Editor Audio Track support. Audio clips are now enabled in Timeline, using a scheduling API.
*   Build Pipeline: Added delegates to BuildPlayerWindow that allow overriding the default Build button behavior
*   Collab: In-Progress. In-Progress allows developers using Unity Collaborate to see who else on their team has made local changes to a Scene or Prefab before those changes have been published.
*   Collab: Project Browser Filters including 'All Modified', 'All Excluded', 'All Conflicts', 'All In Progress'
*   Collab: Right Click Menu Options in the Project Browser including See Differences, Revert, Conflict Resolution
*   Editor: Added new ArcHandle class in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls to interactively edit arcs in the Scene View.
*   Editor: Experimental feature : retained-mode UI system for the Editor (UIElements)
*   Editor: MacOS: Support Visual Studio for Mac as an External Script Editor. Opens .sln (solution) file when double clicking a script.
*   GI: Added new API for setting Light falloff per Light. Added API for setting all Lights to use physically correct inverse squared falloff or the Unity legacy falloff model. Only used for Enlighten lightmaps so far, realtime and progressive will be supported later.
*   Graphics: Added LineUtility class and 'LineRenderer.Simply' function. Optimize your lines and curves by using the LineUtility to create a simplified version with a similar shape.
*   Graphics: Added memoryless mode to RenderTexture, accessed through new property RenderTexture.memorylessMode.
*   Graphics: Added Mirror and MirrorOnce texture wrapping modes, in addition to existing Repeat and Clamp ones.
*   Graphics: Added RenderTextureDescriptor struct that allows you to copy and create RenderTextures by passing a single value.
*   Graphics: Unity can now accept and use a pointer to an externally created cubemap
*   IL2CPP: Unity in-app purchase now works on Windows Store with the IL2CPP scripting backend.
*   IMGUI: Added SearchField, a new IMGUI Control. It comes with Normal and Toolbar UI styles but can also be customized.
*   iOS: (Also mentioned under API Changes) Added API to change iOS splashscreens.
*   iOS: Enable deferred shading rendering path for Metal and OpenGL ES 3.0 for A8 and later iOS devices.
*   Particles: Added support for using Sprites in the Particle System, via the Texture Sheet Animation Module
*   Particles: Align Particles to their velocity direction
*   Particles: Apply Noise Module data to particles sizes and rotations, and also send the noise data to your shaders via new Custom Vertex Streams.
*   Particles: Mesh particles now support the same Render Alignment options are billboarded particles
*   Particles: New Donut emission shape.
*   Particles: Particles can now apply forces to the Colliders they hit
*   Particles: Play Particle Systems when your game is paused, by choosing to use either Scaled or Unscaled time for the simulation.
*   Particles: The Shape Module now contains an additional Transform, for applying custom transformations to the emitter shape.
*   Physics: Add ability to manully simulate 2D physics using "Physics2D.Simulate(time)" and turn auto simulation on/off with "Physics2D.autoSimulation=true/false".
*   Physics: Added 'Joint2D.attachedRigidbody' property to retrieve the Rigidbody2D attached to the Joint2D.
*   Physics: Expose Physics.Simulate and Physics.autoSimulation. This allows stepping the physics simulation manually, from scripts. Useful for customising the server-side physics, in-editor simulation, and more.
*   Physics: Exposed Joint.massScale & Joint.connectedMassScale. This allows adjusting masses and inertia tensors of the connected bodies as perceived by the solver. It's mostly useful for ragdolls that have high forces applied to their limbs and thus experiencing unpleasant stretchiness. This should also help avoiding setting the same mass for all the body parts of a ragdoll, as recommended before. See more in the API docs.
*   Physics: When setting 'Rigidbody2D.simulated' to false, Editor inspector shows information about its effect.
*   Playables: Playable Assets added to Playable API.
*   Playables: Playable Director added to play Playable Assets
*   Playables: Timeline Editor and Runtime API. A tool for sequencing animation, scripts and audio.
*   Shaders: Added support for "inline" sampler states.
    *   HLSL SamplerState objects that aren't taking sampling state from any texture (like what "sampler"+TextureName samplers do), but where sampling state is instead derived from the name.
    *   For example, "MyLinearClampSampler" sets up bilinear filtering and clamp wrap mode; while "point\_repeat\_sampler" sets up point filtering and repeat wrap mode.
    *   This allows e.g. doing both PCF depth comparison and reading raw depth value from a shadow map in a single shader.
    *   Note that generally only modern graphics APIs support separate textures & samplers. You might therefore want to specify #pragma target 3.5 or similar in your shaders for this.
    *   Implemented on DX11, DX12, PS4, XB1, Metal (Vulkan not yet).
*   Web: A new UnityWebRequest.timeout property that gives the user some coarse-grain control over the time a webrequest can take before unity attempts to cancel it.
*   Windows: Multi-display support for UWP.

### Changes

*   Asset Import: Upgraded FBX SDK to 2016.1.2
*   Build Pipeline: Added new function SwitchActiveBuildTargetAsync. This defers switching so that scripts can be imported first.
*   Build Pipeline: Event EditorBuildSettings.activeBuildTargetChanged has been deprecated as events do not survive script reloading. Replaced with interface class IActiveBuildTargetChanged and attribute ActiveBuildTargetChanged.
*   Editor: Added new GameObject sub menu - 'GameObject/Effects/. This menu includes a Line andTrail creation. The particle system has also been moved to this menu.
*   Editor: Added requirement for Visual C++ Runtime 2013 and 2015 to be installed when installing Windows Editor (i.e. the check is performed by Windows Editor installer).
*   Editor: AssetServer version control support has been removed from the editor.
*   Editor: Moved particle system rigidbody info message to top of the system as it does not just apply to inherit velocity
*   Editor: New projects now default to text-based serialization
*   Editor: Particle trail material slot is now always visible even if it is not used.
*   Editor: RenderDoc enabled for DX12 Editor mode.
*   Light modes: Shadowmask and Distance shadowmask modes are now a Quality Setting and can be changed at runtime.
*   OSX: Disabled Metal on macOS 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 for stability reasons if GLCore is also present in API list
*   VR: Added OpenVR to the default PC VR SDK list. The default behavior is to try initializing Oculus first, followed by OpenVR if an Oculus device isn't detected.
*   VR: GPU skinning can be enabled for Android VR. This is experimental, and behavior and performance should be verified on target devices.
*   VR: Updated Google NDK for Android and iOS to 1.40
*   Windows: "Visible In Background" player setting now defaults to on.
*   Windows: Renamed "Windows Store" to "Universal Windows Platform" in the build window
*   Windows Store: DX11 feature level 9.3 GPU support is required now. In practice this probably does not affect anything, as all Windows Phones that ever existed support 9.3 level already.
*   Windows Store: Removed support for building Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 applications.

### Improvements

*   Android: Add default equals, hashCode and toString implementations to AndroidJavaProxy
