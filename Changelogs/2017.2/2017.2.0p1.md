### Improvements

*   2D - Exposed methods to set and retrieve Physics Shape from a Sprite.
*   2D - Sprites created by importing a texture now have a default Physics Shape generated.
*   Graphics - Added APIs to retrieve areas safe for UI rendering. Currently supported on iOS and tvOS only.
*   iOS - Added identification enums for iPhone 8, 8+ and X.
*   Shaders - Concatenated matrix macros (e.g. UNITY\_MATRIX\_MVP) are now changed to static variables to avoid repeated calculations.
*   tvOS - Implemented support for 4K AppleTV icons and splashscreens.
*   XR - Improved performance on Windows Mixed Reality by removing a potential thread stall that would occur whenever beginning a new frame while the previous frame had not completed presenting.
