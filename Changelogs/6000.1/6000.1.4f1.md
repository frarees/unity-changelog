    ([UUM-103926](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-tilemap-gameobject-causes-other-tilemap-gameobjects-to-become-invisible-when-its-mask-interaction-is-set-to-visible-inside-mask))

    (SUS-5708)

    (SUS-5711)

    ([UUM-101710](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unityevents-break-when-a-different-object-is-assigned))

- Editor: Editor can crash when playable graph topology is changed by an animation event callback.
    ([UUM-104081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mecanim-animation-transformvaluesfromclip-when-entering-the-play-mode-in-a-project-with-animancer-pro-v8))

- Editor: Fixed macro redefinition warnings by first checking if PUNCTUAL_SHADOW_LOW, USE_FPTL_LIGHTLIST and DIRECTIONAL_SHADOW_LOW have already been defined previously.

- Editor: Fixed some performance issues when moving Terrain objects \(eg. for shifting world origin to support large worlds\) while Tree rendering is disabled. Renderers for tree instances would still be updated but this is not particularly useful or wanted if you are using some other system to render Tree instances. So now the updating of tree instances is bypassed in this scenario. Re-enabling tree rendering will resume updating tree instance and detail renderers. When tree rendering is enabled, performance remains roughly the same as before.
    ([UUM-98086](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/frame-spike-due-to-many-treerenderer-dot-treeupdated-calls-when-repositioning-terrains-in-large-scenes))

- Graphics: Replaced IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettingsContextMenu interface by IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettingsContextMenu2 to remove the PropertyDrawer argument that was recreated \(contained data lost\) when a DomainReload occured. The new interface replace it by a SerializedProperty onto the IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings instead.
    (UUM-99684)

- Graphics: Upgraded DLSS version from v3.1.10 to v3.7.20, fixing some ghosting artifacts and improving image stability.
