### 6000.1.8f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- iOS: Added support for CAMetalDisplayLink. It is enabled by default on ios \(when built with xcode15+ and run ios17+\). It can be overriden at runtime by tweaking/overriding \[UnityAppController shouldUseMetalDisplayLink\] method. By default it is disabled on tvos, since most of them are slow, and failing to catch up with target FPS \(on complex scenes\) will result in confusing GPU hang messages.
    ([UUM-66493](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-framerate-drops-when-screen-is-touched-on-promotion-devices))
