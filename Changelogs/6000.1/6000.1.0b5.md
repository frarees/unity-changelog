Use this asset to create filters for Android Devices and to determine whether Vulkan can be enabled on the device and, if so, what the preferred graphics jobs mode would be for that device enabling runtime graphics jobs mode selection.

- Graphics: Added RayTracingAccelerationStructure.UpdateInstanceGeometry API to manually trigger a geometry acceleration structure \(BLAS\) update. Added RayTracingMode.DynamicGeometryManualUpdate to be used in conjunction with UpdateInstanceGeometry function. This mode can be configured in Renderers or specified when using RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance\(s\) functions.

- Graphics: Added the new C\# API `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.RemoveInstances`, which removes ray tracing instances from an acceleration structure based on their layer or ray tracing mode.

    ([AVPB-443](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onapplicationfocus-isnt-called-when-the-application-goes-in-or-out-of-focus))

- Web: Fixed web browser to not hang when using Autoconnect Profiler with Build and Run, when the Unity project is set to log large amounts of text at web page startup. Note however that there will still exist a platform-specific limitation that only about 45000 log messages can be printed back-to-back at web page startup, or otherwise the message send queue gets full. If more than 45000 log messages need to be printed back to the Editor, they should be done at page runtime after PlayerConnection has initialized, to avoid this WebSocket limitation.

- Windows: Corrected explicit mention of x64 for WindowsStandalone BuildTarget, it used for all 64-bit Windows Standalone targets.
    (UUM-87185)

- Windows: Fixed an issue where change in the default icon isn't refreshed by the Windows Explorer when re-building a project into the previously used build folder.
    ([UUM-71022](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/changing-the-default-icon-does-not-change-the-executables-icon-when-re-building-the-project))

- Windows: On Windows, we reduced how often we re-enumerate the list of audio devices, which causes a main thread stall. If an audio output device is added or removed, but the default device does not change, then we no longer re-enumerate. If an audio input device is added or removed, we defer the re-enumerate operation until the Unity app actually requests the updated list of microphones via C\#.
