### 6000.1.7f1 Release Notes

#### Fixes

- 2D: Fixed FullScreenRendererFeature exception when use with Rendergraph 2D.
    ([UUM-104830](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-and-argumentexception-are-thrown-and-scene-slash-game-views-do-not-render-when-render-graph-is-enabled-and-requirements-are-set-in-full-screen-pass-renderer-feature))

- 2D: Fixed normals to account for Sprite FlipXY.
    (UUM-104352)

- Android: The application will continue to update/render while built for 'GameActivity + run in split screen + permission dialog is shown' if RunWithFocus is set to true. Previously the application would pause for GameActivity, but would continue to run if built for Activity.
    (UUM-105630)

- Editor: Added new callback `onDeleteArrayElementCallback ` to `ReorderableList`. This is called from the "Delete Array Element" context menu to let you control the removal, like `onRemoveCallback`.
    ([UUM-104534](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onremovecallback-is-not-called-when-removing-an-element-from-the-reoderablelist-using-contextmenu))

- Editor: Fixed a Windows Editor crash on exit that could occur with some specific combinations of packages such as Google Mobile Ads and JetBrains Rider integration.
    ([UUM-103723](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-pluginmanager-refreshplugins-when-closing-the-editor-without-making-any-changes-with-jetbrains-rider-selected-as-the-external-code-editor-and-google-mobile-ads-third-party-plugin-imported))

- Editor: Fixed an issue where Scene view gizmo icons were not loaded properly if "Load textures on demand" was enabled in project settings.
    ([UUM-104825](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/load-texture-data-on-demand-corrupts-unitys-packages-gizmos-in-scene-view))

- Editor: Fixed case where ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture\(\) could cause the player or editor to crash when a XR device was connected.
    ([UUM-103220](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/capturescreenshotastexture-fails-when-vr-headset-is-connected-and-is-inactive-during-play-mode))

- Editor: Fixed IMGUI Errors on LinuxEditor arising when RepaintImmediately\(\) called on window currently being painted.
    ([UUM-104622](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-using-ctrl-plus-alt-plus-a-shortcut-for-add-component-throws-gui-rendering-errors))

- Editor: Fixed macOS progress bars always being shown on the main display rather than over the main Editor window.
    ([UUM-102920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/progress-bar-defaults-to-main-monitor-when-editor-is-on-secondary-monitor))

- Editor: Fixed `PlayerSettings` icon APIs so that `GetIcons`, `GetIconsForTargetGroup`, `GetIconSizes`, and `GetIconSizesForTargetGroup` return the correct icon arrays for the provided `NamedBuildTarget` or `BuildTargetGroup` argument.
    ([UUM-97474](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-settings-icons-are-not-retrieved-when-using-playersettings-dot-geticons-method))

- Graphics: BatchRendererGroup's OnPerformCulling function now correctly checks for job safety between the provided buffers and the JobHandle returned by the user.
    ([UUM-98559](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/no-error-slash-warning-in-console-when-batchrenderergroup-reads-draw-commands-before-culling-jobs-are-complete))

- Graphics: Fixed duplicated color resolve when mixing native render pass and set render target workflows.
    (UUM-103751)

- HDRP: Prevent CustomPass using camera depth if the injection point is set to AfterPostprocess. Show a warning in the CustomPass inspector if this configuration is present.
    ([UUM-79283](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/drawrendererescustompass-onpostprocess-only-draws-within-the-original-render-area-when-dynamic-resolution-is-enabled-and-graphics-api-is-set-to-directx12))

- Kernel: JobHandle.Complete\(\) goes to sleep sooner when there is no work to steal. This allows the waiting thread to give up the CPU core sooner to allow another thread to perform work or to preserve battery life.
    (UUM-83082)

- Package Manager: Fixed an issue where installing a git package using Git LFS would not work with Git LFS 3.6.0 and higher.
    (UUM-91342)

- Package Manager: Fixed the issue where Assets cannot be imported when the Asset package contains project settings and all project settings are unchanged.
    ([UUM-100078](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assets-do-not-get-imported-from-an-asset-package-when-library-assets-in-the-asset-package-are-unchanged))

- Physics: Better tooltips for PhysicsSettings window.
    (UUM-105527)

- UI Elements: Fixed the items not expanding on creation when autoExpand is set to true.
    ([UUM-107968](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/multicolumntreeview-does-not-auto-expand-foldouts-when-autoexpand-is-set-to-true))

- UI Toolkit: Fixed USS preview is not updated when a selector is moved to a new USS file.
    ([UUM-104904](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uss-code-is-not-updated-when-a-selector-is-deleted-or-is-moved-to-a-new-uss-file))

- Undo System: Keep undo stack in sync during project load by pausing serialization.
    (UUM-97070)

- URP: Fixed unclear warnings when user creates more lights than the light limit when using Deferred rendering path.
    ([UUM-102023](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/property-additionalshadowparams-exceeds-previous-array-size-41-vs-32-dot-dot-dot-warning-is-spammed-when-exceeding-the-light-limit-set-in-urp-config-package))

- Video: Fixed double invocation of onLoopPoint callback when `skipOnDrop` is false and codec is decoding to memory.
    ([UUM-97953](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/videoplayer-dot-looppointreached-invokes-twice-when-waitforfirstframe-is-enabled))
