### Improvements

*   Physics 2D: Added 'AreaEffector2D.useGlobalAngle' to allow the selection of whether the force-angle is global or local.
*   Physics 2D: Added 'Effector2D.useColliderMask' to allow the selection of whether the effector collider mask is used or the global collision matrix.
*   Physics 2D: Added 'Rigidbody2D.IsTouching' and 'Rigidbody2D.IsTouchingLayers' to complement the same on 'Collider2D' and 'Physics2D'.
*   Physics 2D: Renamed 'AreaEffector2D.forceDirection' to 'AreaEffector2D.forceAngle' (sciprts are automaticallly updated).
