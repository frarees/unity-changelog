#### Features

*   Platforms: Unity Professional users can now optionally show the builtin Unity Splash Screen on applicable platforms. Setting is in the Player Settings.

#### Improvements

*   Android: Added FB clear to devices that would prefer discard FB but don't have the discard frame buffer extension.
*   Android: Added profiling stats for blit to screen and input processing.
*   Android: Joystick input optimization, fixes slowdown on some older devices.
*   Android: Parsing device specific xml font configurations to determine system/fallback fonts in addition to the hard-coded list of fontnames.
*   Android: Splash screen is now shown in full screen mode.
*   GI: Don't calculate AO when AO exponent is 0.
*   GI: Output more stats per system and in total: vertex count, face count, chart count and texel count.
*   GI: Removed an unnecessary warning that realtime GI is not supported on PS3 and Xbox360 when finishing a bake in non-continuous mode.
*   GI: Sped up baked lightmaps compositing.
*   GI: Spit out timings of the precompute and bake to the Editor log. Timer resets when clearing GI data, exiting continuous mode or cancelling a bake.

    *   Added option to disable launch screen
    *   Added option to display relatively sized image on a specific background
*   Linux: Query Mesa driver for amount of video memory when feasible.
*   Physics 2D: Joint2D property 'collideConnected' renamed to 'enableCollision' to match 3D physics.
*   Physics 2D: PlatformEffector2D property renames based upon feedback: oneWay->useOneWay, sideFriction->useSideFriction & sideBounce->useSideBounce.
