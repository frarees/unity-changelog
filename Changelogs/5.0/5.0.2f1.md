### Features

*   XboxOne: The default update granularity used by XDK's makepkg tool has changed to File granularity rather than Chunk granularity. There is now a setting to control this:
    *   Player Settings > Xbox One > Microsoft Xbox One Package Settings > Update Granularity. This property is set to File by default. Chunk is recommended only for games that have already been released using the Chunk granularity, which was the default prior to this build.

### Improvements

*   Editor: Added Android 5.0 and 5.1 to "Minimum API Level" list.

*   iOS/IL2CPP: Avoid generating NullReference checks on value types.
*   iOS/IL2CPP: Improve performance of finally blocks.
*   iOS/Metal: Better support for native rendering plugins when using Metal.
