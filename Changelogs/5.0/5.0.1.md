## Release Notes

### Improvements

-   Android: Added framebuffer clear on devices that would prefer framebuffer discard but don\'t have the required GLES extension.
-   Android: Added profiling stats for blit to screen and input processing.
-   Android: Joystick input optimization, fixes slowdown on some older devices.
-   Android: Parsing device specific XML font configurations to determine system/fallback fonts in addition to the hard-coded list of font names (in 4.6.4 too).
-   Android: Splash screen is now shown in full screen mode.
-   BlackBerry: Passport device now supports landscape orientation.
-   Bug reporter: Added info about license type.
-   Editor: Android; added ability to configure JDK path in the Editor preferences (in 4.6.4 too).
-   Editor: Android TV; added configuration option for D-pad and gamepad support level.
-   GI: Added pushoff for baked lighting, can be used to fix AO artefacts.
-   GI: Allow higher AO exponent in Lighting window.
-   GI: Don\'t calculate AO when AO exponent is 0.
-   GI: Fixed inconsistent Enlighten build timings; now it should correspond to wall clock time (unless you move at near speed of light relative to your computer, in which case it might still be wrong).
-   GI: Moved baked tag to the proper place in UI.
-   GI: Output more stats per system and in total: vertex count, face count, chart count and texel count.
-   GI: Removed an unnecessary warning that realtime GI is not supported on PS3 and Xbox360 when finishing a bake in non-continuous mode.
-   GI: Sped up baked lightmap compositing.
-   GI: Spit out timings of the precompute and bake to the Editor log. Timer resets when clearing GI data, exiting continuous mode or cancelling a bake.
