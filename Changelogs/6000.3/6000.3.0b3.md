### Preview of Final 6000.3.0b3 Release Notes

#### Features

- 2D: Added Mesh Renderer and Skinned Mesh Renderer 2D workflow support for 2D URP.

- Accessibility: Extended the platform support of the screen reader support APIs to Windows and macOS, allowing Unity desktop applications to be made compatible with Narrator \(Windows\) and VoiceOver \(macOS\).

- Android: Added app category support to allow users to retain Android 15 orientation and rotation behavior when running on Android 16.

- Android: Added AppCategory analytics to support the collection of app category data.

- Android: Added HTTP/2 support for UnityWebRequest on Android.

- Audio: In the global audio project settings, if the "Audio Foundation" property is set to "Enhanced", a new platform audio foundation is used on Windows and macOS. More platforms will be supported in future versions of Unity. In enhanced mode, the Unity audio engine will run at the channel layout and sampling rate selected via the new "Output Channel Layout" and "Output Sampling Rate" properties. The enhanced audio foundation executes the format conversions necessary to translate from the engine's format to the audio device's native format. This avoids the current issue where the audio engine may reset and lose all state when the default audio output device changes. In addition, in enhanced mode, all expensive platform audio operations, like enumerating, starting, and stopping devices, are all executed off the main thread, so there should be no more main thread hitches.

- Build System: Set up Bee to better use with either MSVC dynamic or static CRT.

- Editor: Added new functionality to the Editor dialog box API that will allow for icon choices, and opt out choices. Refer to EditorDialog in the Unity Documentation for more details.

- Editor: Added performance indicators to the Windows Editor launch window. These indicators display when the Editor is built from source or the *Developer Mode* Editor preference is enabled.

- Editor: Added SceneView debug labels and color coded bounds for MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer to display active Mesh LOD for meshes with LODs.

- Editor: Added the ability to dock overlays as full-height dynamic panels in the Scene view.

- Editor: Made the Editor Launch Screen draggable on Linux.

- Editor: Moved Adaptive Performance 6 from a package to the Unity core. Bundled provider packages with the Unity Editor.

- Editor: The main Toolbar of the Editor is now extensible and customizable.

- Editor: Updated the WebGLSupport artifact for the Mac Editor on Arm64 to be natively built on a Mac Arm64 computer.

- EmbeddedLinux: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on EmbeddedLinux.

    - Added options in the Project Settings and Build Profile windows to enable or disable engine diagnostics data collection. This feature is enabled by default in new Unity 6.2 projects.<br>
    Scripting:<br>
    - Added `ConsentState.AnalyticsIntent` and `ConsentState.AdsIntent` APIs. Use these APIs to define the purposes of data processing.

- GI: Added a new lightmap packing algorithm based on the third-party xAtlas library. This packer is now the default for new scenes, while older scenes will automatically continue to use the previous packer.

- GI: Published the Unified Raytracing API, which provides an API for creating cross-platform ray tracing shaders.

- Graphics: Added Split Graphics Jobs support to Metal.

- Graphics: Added support for hit shaders in .raytrace files. The GPU executes the hit shaders by default if the expected Shader Pass \(specified using `RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass`\) is not found in .shader files used by geometries in the acceleration structure.

- Graphics: Added `MeshRenderer` and `SkinnedMeshRenderer` shader user value API to set a per-renderer unsigned int value. This value can be retrieved in shader code to modify the shader value per object, using a single material.

- IL2CPP: Backport metadata reductions: reduce size of string literal data and type definition data by computing the length of each string during deserialization, removing `Il2CppTypeDefinition::elementTypeIndex`, and encoding the elementType in `Il2CppTypeDefinition::parentIndex`.

- Kepler: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Kepler.

- License: Enabled the Package Manager to check entitlements for Asset Store Unity Package Manager \(UPM\) packages and regular packages.
