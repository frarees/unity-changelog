### New 6000.3.0a5 Entries since 6000.3.0a3

#### Features

- 2D: Added Mesh Renderer and Skinned Mesh Renderer 2D workflow support for 2D URP.

- Android: Added AppCategory analytics to support the collection of app category data.

- Android: Added HTTP/2 support for UnityWebRequest on Android.

- Audio: In the global audio project settings, if the "Audio Foundation" property is set to "Enhanced", a new platform audio foundation will be used on Windows and macOS. More platforms will be supported in future versions of Unity. In enhanced mode, the Unity audio engine will run at the channel layout and sampling rate selected via the new "Output Channel Layout" and "Output Sampling Rate" properties. The enhanced audio foundation will execute the format conversions necessary to translate from the engine's format to the audio device's native format. This avoids the current issue where the audio engine may reset and lose all state when the default audio output device changes. In addition, in enhanced mode, all expensive platform audio operations, like enumerating, starting, and stopping devices, are all executed off the main thread, so there should be no more main thread hitches.

- Editor: Adaptive Performance 6 is moved from being delivered as a package to Unity core. Provider packages are moved to be bundled with the Unity Editor.

- Editor: Added SceneView debug labels and color coded bounds for MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer to display active Mesh LOD for meshes with LODs.

- Kepler: VOX-3023: Enable HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Kepler.

- License: Assetstore entitlement checks.

- Linux: VOX-3023: Enable HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Linux.

- Package Manager: Add the `Create UPM Package...` option to the Project Browser and Assets contextual menus.

- Package Manager: Added a clear warning when a package has no signature.

- Package Manager: Added an "Export as UPM package" option to the context menu, and changed current export option to "Export as Asset Package".

- Package Manager: Added messages in the Editor to improve visibility into package signature validation as part of ongoing efforts to enhance safety and standardization.

- Package Manager: Introduced an "Export Package" button in the Package Manager that enables users to export a package locally as a tarball to their file system.

- QNX: VOX-3023: Enable HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on QNX.

- Shadergraph: Added three new options to the Unlit target: Keep Lighting Variants, Default Decal Blending, and Default SSAO. These options enable you to more effectively create custom lighting models using the Unlit target. For examples, refer to the Shader Graph Custom Lighting sample content in the documentation.

- Shaders: Users can now add project-wide shader keyword list declaration overrides from Graphics Settings. It is possible to both switch between statically compiled variants and dynamic branching and completely remove keywords that are never used.

- Terrain: Added shadergraph support for terrain shaders. Supports HDRP &amp; URP pipelines, added a new subtarget type, and a new node for loading terrain data.

- UI Toolkit: Added the Image element to the UI Builder library and exposed its properties as UXML attributes.

### Preview of Final 6000.3.0a5 Release Notes

#### Features

- 2D: Added Mesh Renderer and Skinned Mesh Renderer 2D workflow support for 2D URP.

- Accessibility: Extended the platform support of the screen reader support APIs to Windows and macOS, allowing Unity desktop applications to be made compatible with Narrator \(Windows\) and VoiceOver \(macOS\).

- Android: Added app category support to allow users to retain Android 15 orientation and rotation behavior when running on Android 16.

- Android: Added AppCategory analytics to support the collection of app category data.

- Android: Added HTTP/2 support for UnityWebRequest on Android.

- Audio: In the global audio project settings, if the "Audio Foundation" property is set to "Enhanced", a new platform audio foundation will be used on Windows and macOS. More platforms will be supported in future versions of Unity. In enhanced mode, the Unity audio engine will run at the channel layout and sampling rate selected via the new "Output Channel Layout" and "Output Sampling Rate" properties. The enhanced audio foundation will execute the format conversions necessary to translate from the engine's format to the audio device's native format. This avoids the current issue where the audio engine may reset and lose all state when the default audio output device changes. In addition, in enhanced mode, all expensive platform audio operations, like enumerating, starting, and stopping devices, are all executed off the main thread, so there should be no more main thread hitches.

- Build System: Set up Bee to better use with either MSVC dynamic or static CRT.

- Editor: Adaptive Performance 6 is moved from being delivered as a package to Unity core. Provider packages are moved to be bundled with the Unity Editor.

- Editor: Added new functionality to the Editor dialog box API that will allow for icon choices, and opt out choices. Refer to EditorDialog in the Unity Documentation for more details.

- Editor: Added performance indicators to the Windows Editor launch window. These indicators display when the Editor is built from source or the *Developer Mode* Editor preference is enabled.

- Editor: Added SceneView debug labels and color coded bounds for MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer to display active Mesh LOD for meshes with LODs.

- Editor: Added the ability to dock overlays as full-height dynamic panels in the Scene view.

- Editor: Made the Editor Launch Screen draggable on Linux.

- Editor: The main Toolbar of the Editor is now extensible and customizable.

- GI: Published the Unified Raytracing API, which provides an API for creating cross-platform ray tracing shaders.

- Graphics: Added Split Graphics Jobs support to Metal.

- Graphics: Added support for hit shaders in .raytrace files. The GPU executes the hit shaders by default if the expected Shader Pass \(specified using `RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass`\) is not found in .shader files used by geometries in the acceleration structure.

- Graphics: New MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer shader user value API to set a per renderer unsigned int value that can be retrieved in shader code to modify the shader value per object, using a single material.

- IL2CPP: Backport metadata reductions: reduce size of string literal data and type definition data by computing the length of each string during deserialization, removing `Il2CppTypeDefinition::elementTypeIndex`, and encoding the elementType in `Il2CppTypeDefinition::parentIndex`.

- Kepler: VOX-3023: Enable HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Kepler.

These options enable you to more effectively create custom lighting models using the Unlit target. For examples, refer to the Shader Graph Custom Lighting sample content in the documentation.

- Shaders: Users can now add project-wide shader keyword list declaration overrides from Graphics Settings. It is possible to both switch between statically compiled variants and dynamic branching and completely remove keywords that are never used.

    * Dual filtering is suitable for larger resolutions.<br>
    * Gaussian filtering remains the best choice for quality and stability.<br>
    Each filter requires unique settings to achieve visual parity.

For instance, the `Scene.handle` property is now of `SceneHandle` type instead of `int` and might cause a binary compatibility issue. Other APIs still using `int` to represent a scene handle will gradually move to use `SceneHandle` in the future.

- Scripting: Deprecated: TransformAccessArray.Add\(int\) is deprecated. Please use TransformAccessArray.Add\(EntityId\) instead.
