### Preview of Final 6000.3.0b8 Release Notes

#### Features

- 2D: Added Mesh Renderer and Skinned Mesh Renderer 2D workflow support for 2D URP.

- Accessibility: Extended the platform support of the screen reader support APIs to Windows and macOS, allowing Unity desktop applications to be made compatible with Narrator \(Windows\) and VoiceOver \(macOS\).

- Android: Added app category support to allow users to retain Android 15 orientation and rotation behavior when running on Android 16.

- Android: Added AppCategory analytics to support the collection of app category data.

- Android: Added HTTP/2 support for UnityWebRequest on Android.

- Audio: In the global audio project settings, if the "Audio Foundation" property is set to "Enhanced", a new platform audio foundation is used on Windows and macOS. More platforms will be supported in future versions of Unity. In enhanced mode, the Unity audio engine will run at the channel layout and sampling rate selected via the new "Output Channel Layout" and "Output Sampling Rate" properties. The enhanced audio foundation executes the format conversions necessary to translate from the engine's format to the audio device's native format. This avoids the current issue where the audio engine may reset and lose all state when the default audio output device changes. In addition, in enhanced mode, all expensive platform audio operations, like enumerating, starting, and stopping devices, are all executed off the main thread, so there should be no more main thread hitches.

- Build System: Set up Bee to better use with either MSVC dynamic or static CRT.

- Editor: Added new functionality to the Editor dialog box API that will allow for icon choices, and opt out choices. Refer to EditorDialog in the Unity Documentation for more details.

- Editor: Added performance indicators to the Windows Editor launch window. These indicators display when the Editor is built from source or the *Developer Mode* Editor preference is enabled.

- Editor: Added SceneView debug labels and color coded bounds for MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer to display active Mesh LOD for meshes with LODs.

- Editor: Added the ability to dock overlays as full-height dynamic panels in the Scene view.

- Editor: Made the Editor Launch Screen draggable on Linux.

- Editor: Moved Adaptive Performance 6 from a package to the Unity core. Bundled provider packages with the Unity Editor.

- Editor: The main Toolbar of the Editor is now extensible and customizable.

- Editor: Updated the WebGLSupport artifact for the Mac Editor on Arm64 to be natively built on a Mac Arm64 computer.

- EmbeddedLinux: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on EmbeddedLinux.

- Engine Diagnostics: Engine Diagnostics:<br>
    - Added options in the Project Settings and Build Profile windows to enable or disable engine diagnostics data collection. This feature is enabled by default in new Unity 6.2 projects.<br>
    Scripting:<br>
    - Added `ConsentState.AnalyticsIntent` and `ConsentState.AdsIntent` APIs. Use these APIs to define the purposes of data processing.

- GI: Added a new lightmap packing algorithm based on the third-party xAtlas library. This packer is now the default for new scenes, while older scenes will automatically continue to use the previous packer.

- GI: Published the Unified Raytracing API, which provides an API for creating cross-platform ray tracing shaders.

- Graphics: Added Split Graphics Jobs support to Metal.

- Graphics: Added support for hit shaders in .raytrace files. The GPU executes the hit shaders by default if the expected Shader Pass \(specified using `RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass`\) is not found in .shader files used by geometries in the acceleration structure.

- Graphics: Added `MeshRenderer` and `SkinnedMeshRenderer` shader user value API to set a per-renderer unsigned int value. This value can be retrieved in shader code to modify the shader value per object, using a single material.

- IL2CPP: Backport metadata reductions: reduce size of string literal data and type definition data by computing the length of each string during deserialization, removing `Il2CppTypeDefinition::elementTypeIndex`, and encoding the elementType in `Il2CppTypeDefinition::parentIndex`.

- Kepler: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Kepler.

- License: Enabled the Package Manager to check entitlements for Asset Store Unity Package Manager \(UPM\) packages and regular packages.

- Linux: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Linux.

- macOS: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on the Mac platform.

- Multiplayer: Enabled users to toggle a profiler window panel within clone editors for Multiplayer Play Mode.

- Package Manager: Add the `Create UPM Package...` option to the Project Browser and Assets contextual menus.

- Package Manager: Added a *Leave a Review* link for packages on the Asset Store in the Package Manager.

- Package Manager: Added a clear warning message for users when a package has an invalid signature.

- Package Manager: Added a clear warning when a package has no signature.

- Package Manager: Added a warning notification to the Package Manager button in the Editor toolbar for users who have packages with errors or warnings in their project.

- Package Manager: Added an "Export as UPM package" option to the context menu, and changed current export option to "Export as Asset Package".

- Package Manager: Added an "Export Package" button in the Package Manager that enables users to export a package locally as a tarball to their file system.

- Package Manager: Added Errors and Warnings section in the sidebar.

- Package Manager: Added messages in the Editor to improve visibility into package signature validation as part of ongoing efforts to enhance safety and standardization.

- Package Manager: Added messages in the Package Manager window to improve visibility of package signature validation.

- Package Manager: Added support for package signing using the Unity Command Line Interface \(CLI\) in batch mode.

- Package Manager: Added the `pinnedPackages` optional property to the project manifest. This feature forces specified direct dependencies to use their exact manifest versions during package resolution and project update.

- Package Manager: Display package errors in a warning pop-up when opening a project.

- Package Manager: Users can now easily create packages from the Package Manager window.

- Physics 2D: Added conversion operators for `LowLevelPhysics2D.PhysicsJoint`.

- Physics 2D: Added extra safety when locking physics worlds so that using invalid bodies, shapes or joints always produces a lock and displays a nice console warning.

- Physics 2D: Added new low-level 2D physics API based upon Box2D v3. This does not interact with or change the existing API or components at this time. Later, this new API will replace the existing API and be integrated into the existing components.

- Physics 2D: The LowLevelPhysics2D renderer now performs orthographic render culling, which significantly improves debug rendering performance in large scenes.

- Physics 2D: The `LowLevelPhysics2D.PhysicsRotate` property drawer now shows angles labelled as "Angle" and not "Degrees".

- Player: Added support for building dedicated server players that target Linux Arm64 platforms using IL2CPP.

- Profiler: Added the Overview feature to the Highlights Profiler module.

- Profiler: Added Unity Profiler Capture List that shows recent profiling sessions and information.

- QNX: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on QNX.

- QNX: Enabled specifying the `SCREEN_PROPERTY_PIPELINE` property for each window.

- Shadergraph: Added a template browser accessible through the Create menu. Users can designate any Shader Graph asset as a template in the Asset Inspector.

- Shadergraph: Added support for additional UV channels where applicable.

    (UUM-99942)

For instance, the `Scene.handle` property is now of `SceneHandle` type instead of `int` and might cause a binary compatibility issue. Other APIs still using `int` to represent a scene handle will gradually move to use `SceneHandle` in the future.

- Scripting: Deprecated: Deprecated `TransformAccessArray.Add(int)`. Use `TransformAccessArray.Add(EntityId)` instead.
