### 6000.3.1f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

- AI: Improved the performance of sampling the nearest position on the NavMesh.
    (UUM-117415)

- Editor: Added a *New Nodes Preview* button to the Shader Graph preferences to add nodes with an expanded preview.

- Editor: Fixed an issue where the progress bar was unresponsive when selecting the *Compile and show code* dropdown menu in the *Shader Inspector* window.
    ([UUM-97524](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/loading-time-and-the-number-of-shader-variants-highly-increase-when-using-a-lit-shader-graph-and-clicking-the-pop-up-menu-of-the-compile-and-show-code))

- Editor: Increased the minimum width of the Sprite Editor window. When undocked, the window can no longer be resized to a width that hides buttons on the toolbar.
    (UUM-127566)

- iOS: Added a workaround for an issue where Metal `CADisplayLink` callbacks were called recursively on some devices. This occurred when plugins loaded WebKit via `NSAttributedString initWithData:options:documentAttributes:error:` during the Unity player loop.

- Linux: Updated the Linux toolchain to improve package handling.

- Physics: Added settings to control how often the Physics system deallocated internal collision, trigger, and joint event buffers. This reduces memory pressure during a physics scene's preparation stage. You can find these settings at *Project Settings* &gt; *Physics* &gt; *Settings* &gt; *GameObjects*, under the *Release Simulation Buffers* section.
    ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))



#### API Changes

- Physics: Added: Added a `Physics` method to manually deallocate collision, trigger, and joint event buffers. Use this when you don't want to enable automatic deallocation and need to recover memory during specific events.
    ([UUM-112248](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-each-time-the-meshcollider-component-is-turned-off-and-on))

- Scripting: Added: - Added the `HierarchyFlattened.AsReadOnlySpan` method to retrieve flattened nodes as a read-only span.<br>
    - Added the `HierarchyViewModel.AsReadOnlySpan` method to retrieve nodes from a hierarchy view model as a read-only span.<br>
    - Added the `HierarchyViewModel.FlagsChanged` event, which is invoked whenever flags changed.<br>
    - Added the `HierarchyViewModel.EndFlagsChangeWithoutNotify` method to end a flags change scope without invoking the `FlagsChanged` event.

- Scripting: Changed: - Modified the `EndFlagsChange` method to return which flags changed, if any.<br>
    - Added a constructor parameter to the `HierarchyViewModelFlagsChangeScope` struct to choose whether the `FlagsChanged` event is invoked at the end.



#### Changes

- iOS: Added support to pause and unpause DisplayLink when the application moved to the background or foreground.

- iOS: Changed how the application presented frames to improve robustness.
