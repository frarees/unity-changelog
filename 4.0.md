## Release notes

### New Animation System

-   Once imported as muscle clips, animations can be used with all humanoid characters with no additional conversions needed.
    -   Use the same animations on different proportion characters with no overhead or need for storing multiple versions of the clip.
    -   Map the bones of your model to human muscles with a single click, or fine tune the setup for full control.
-   Slice up your authored or motion-captured animations directly inside Unity with the industry\'s best tool for the job.
    -   Preview the animation as your drag the ranges of a clip.
    -   Indicators for pose looping quality and motion looping quality lets you easily pick the range with optimal looping.
    -   Differences between start and end pose is smoothed out by the importer to ensure perfect looping.
-   Support for arbitrary animations:
    -   Support for Generic Skeletons.
    -   Support for human avatars with additionals bones ("hybrids").
    -   Preview of generic or hybrid skeleton in Animation Clip, Blend Tree and Transition inspector.

    -   Supports Culling (Animator.cullingMode = AnimatorCullingMode).

### DirectX 11 Rendering

-   On Windows Vista and later, and with DX10 or better level GPU, you can use DirectX 11 now.
-   New features:
    -   Geometry shaders (require DX10 GPU) and hull/domain shaders (require DX11 GPU). #pragma geometry, hull, domain in shader files.
    -   Compute shaders (\*.compute files, ComputeShader in scripts).
    -   ComputeBuffer scripting API (\"structured buffers\" in DX11 lingo). Can use them in compute shaders and regular shader model 5.0 shaders (Material.SetBuffer, Shader.SetGlobalBuffer).
    -   Render textures with \"random write\" access (\"UAVs\" in DX11 lingo). Graphics.SetRandomWriteTarget, RenderTexture.enableRandomWrite.
    -   Graphics.DrawProcedural & DrawProceduralIndirect.
    -   DX11-specific RenderTexture formats: RenderTextureFormat.R8, ARGBInt, RGInt, RInt.
    -   3D RenderTextures (RenderTexture.isVolume, volumeDepth). Fill them as \"random write\" textures from a compute or pixel shader.
    -   In shaders, can optionally use CBUFFER_START(name) .. CBUFFER_END macros to markup separate constant buffers.
-   Usage and documentation:
    -   Player Settings has \"Use DX11\" option; when it it set the editor and player will try using DX11. Editor will have "" in the title bar when it is in DX11 mode.
    -   See "Using DirectX 11" page in the documentation.
    -   New image effects take advantage of DX11: Depth of Field, Camera Motion Blur, Noise.
    -   "Tessellation Shaders" standard package has several shaders that use DX11 tessellation.

### Linux Publishing

-   Export a standalone player for 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x86_64) Linux.
    -   Select \"Linux\" from the Target Platform list in the Build Settings.
    -   After building a Linux player on Windows, you will first need to make the binary executable on Linux before being able to run it. Do this by running \'chmod +x\' on the executable or right clicking and selecting \"Allow to run as application\".
-   Supported Platforms
    -   Standalone players will run on most modern Linux systems with vendor-supplied graphics drivers.
    -   Official support will be provided for 32 or 64-bit Ubuntu Linux, version 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) or newer, with graphics cards using vendor-supplied drivers.

### Graphics Features

-   Terrain: Normal map & custom shader support for Terrain. Added built-in shader Nature/Terrain/Bumped Specular; added \"normal map\" texture slot to terrain splat maps; added Material field under terrain settings.
-   3D (volume) textures support. Currently no way to import them, but you can create them from script (Texture3D) and use them in shaders (sampler3D and tex3D). Also SystemInfo.supports3DTextures.
-   Shadows on mobile devices!
    -   Only directional lights, no shadow cascades, no soft shadows.
    -   Requires GL_OES_depth_texture extension. Most notably, Tegra 2/3-based devices do not support it.
    -   On Android, requires Honeycomb of later OS.
-   Fonts:
    -   Dynamic font rendering on all platforms (including mobiles) with identical results (via FreeType).
    -   Simple html-style text markup support to have multiple font sizes, styles and colors in a string in UnityGUI, GUIText & TextMesh.
-   Image Effects updates:
    -   Depth of Field (Scatter), an improved version of existing Depth of Field 3.4 effect. Has a DX11 mode that splats bokeh sprites on the bright spots.
    -   Camera Motion Blur, does what it says: camera motion based motion blur. Has DX11-optimized mode for better quality.
    -   Noise and Grain does a fancier film noise simulation (also has a DX11-optimized mode).
    -   Bloom, an improved version of Bloom and Lens Flares. New \"High Quality\" mode simulates aberration, glint, better treatment of high frequency parts.
    -   Color Correction LUT effect that uses a 3D texture to do arbitrary color correction.
    -   Edge Detection (Geometry) effect got ability to interact nicely with other depth-based effects (DOF, Motion Blur etc.) with new \"Sobel Depth Thin\" mode.
    -   Color Correction Curves now supports (de)saturation and has a fix for color key correction.
-   Cubemaps:
    -   New Generate Cubemap texture import option that creates a cubemap from vertical/horizontal cross or row/column of images.
    -   Seamless cubemap option that makes sure edges of faces match up. Also runtime scripting API, Cubemap.SmoothEdges.
    -   Cubemap assets reference their original textures in the editor instead of copying their pixels at assign time.
-   Lightmapping: \"Bake selected\" no longer destroys lightmaps on objects that aren\'t selected. Instead it updates lightmaps on selected objects, as expected.
-   Lightmapping: Normalmaps are taken into account when lightmapping, which allows to add detail to lightmaps and makes the transition between near and far distance in Dual Lightmaps mode less visible.
-   Lightmapping: FIxed issue with generated lightmap uvs being different across mac/win on some occasions.
-   Render Textures: added RenderTextureFormat.ARGBFloat, RGFloat, RGHalf, RFloat, RHalf formats.
-   Meshes can have a non-triangle topology now. You can create meshes that are lines, points or quads from scripts. See MeshTopology enum, Mesh.GetIndices, SetIndices, GetTopology.
-   Added SkinnedMeshRenderer.BakeMesh to \"bake\" skinned mesh result into a regular mesh. You can use this to implement semi-instanced crowd rendering schemes.
-   Graphics: Added resizable window support for standalone builds; see Resizable Window option in player settings.
-   LOD: Add an API that allows for the construction / configuration of LODs at runtime. You can now add a LODGroup and configure it without using the UI.
-   Shuriken particle system:
    -   World collision support - world collisions can be high/medium/low quality. High quality raycasts all particles and is expensive. Medium/low quality traces some of the particles, while the rest reuses older collisions. While this is approximate, in many cases where there are a lot of particles it will look fine and perform very well. The ray casting budget is set in quality settings.
    -   Automatic simulation culling support. Particle systems will only update when visible. When it is not possible to support this automatically, Shuriken shows why directly inside the UI.
    -   External forces support - use Wind Zones with particles.
    -   Bent normals support for sprites.
    -   Support for sorting and rendering with immediate children (solving sorting issues for combined systems).
-   Shaders:
    -   Added built-in matrix variables, UNITY_MATRIX_V (view matrix), UNITY_MATRIX_VP (view\*projection).
    -   Added float4 unity_DeltaTime, contains (dt, 1/dt, smoothdt, 1/smoothdt).
    -   Shader helper macros added:
        -   UNITY_DECLARE_SHADOWMAP(tex), UNITY_SAMPLE_SHADOW(tex,uv), UNITY_SAMPLE_SHADOW_PROJ(tex,uv).
        -   UNITY_NEAR_CLIP_VALUE, defined to 0.0 on D3D-like, -1.0 on GL-like platforms.
        -   UNITY_COMPILER_HLSL (d3d11, 360), UNITY_COMPILER_HLSL2GLSL (gles), UNITY_COMPILER_CG if you need to determine which shader compiler is used on a platform.
        -   UNITY_INITIALIZE_OUTPUT(type,name) to help with DX11 shader compiler requiring full initialization of \"out\" parameters.
    -   OpenGL ES 2.0: Supports depth textures on Android.
    -   Scripting API: added Texture.SetGlobalAnisotropicFilteringLimits.

### New Project Browser (replaces the Project Window)

-   View assets by preview icons.
-   Separate tree for folders for better overview of folder structure.
-   Search for assets using droplists for type and asset labels.

-   Enable searching the Asset Store and previewing assets.
-   You can switch Project Browser to old-style one column layout in the context menu of the window (upper right corner).

### Rewrite of the GUI system

-   The existing GUI system (OnGUI) had its core rewritten, optimized and cleaned up. It uses less memory and induces less garbage collection cycles. In some cases we've seen it being 10x faster without GUILayout, and several times faster than previous version when GUILayout is used.
-   Note: this is not the "New GUI" that is coming to a later Unity 4.x release. It's existing GUI, made much faster.

### Other Features

-   Added a new development console to show error messages on screen in development player builds.
-   Android: Added Eclipse project generation.
-   Android: Support for APK Expansion Files (OBBs) - effectively enabling applications larger than 50Mb in the Google Play Store.
-   iOS: Screen.SetResolution now works on iOS too.
-   iOS: Target Resolution Player Setting was redesigned to better suite development workflow on multiple iOS devices. Two new "Auto (Best performance)" and "Auto (Best Quality)" settings allow Unity Runtime to choose most optimal rendering resolution according to device GPU capabilities.
-   Debugger: Web players can now be attached to and debugged just like standalones.
-   Editor: Add components and scripts to Game Objects easier and faster through the new Add Component drop-down directly inside the Inspector.
-   Editor: Create your own Inspector GUI for custom classes or attributes and see it used across all scripts that use those classes or attributes.
-   Fonts: Custom fonts can now use arbitrary character rectangles instead of a fixed grid.
-   Fonts: Font character placement properties are now accessible from scripting.
-   Fonts: Imported fonts can now be converted to editable custom fonts from the gear menu.
-   Gradient (known from the Shuriken editor) is now exposed to scripts: Gradient, GradientColorKey, GradientAlphaKey.
-   Navigation: NavMeshAgent supports prioritized levels of avoidance.
-   Navigation: NavMeshObstacle component added.
-   New Cursor API was introduced:
    -   Cursor API supports both software and hardware cursors.
    -   Support for hardware cursors on the following platforms: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Flash.
    -   Configure the default cursor in your projects' Player Settings.
-   License: New activation system was developed:Ability to un-license a machine yourself!
    -   Continuous license and content updates.
    -   Unity Account login for certain license types.
    -   Surveys for certain license types.
-   New Web Player Update mechanism, which allows multiple runtime versions to be installed at the same time:
    -   Allows running beta content with the beta runtime without having to install a beta plugin (beta runtime will be downloaded automatically).
    -   Optionally allows testing release content using the beta runtime (by default it will be played back using the release runtime), using the context menu.
    -   Allows switching between development and non-development players without plugin reinstallations, using the context menu.
    -   Please note: in order for this to work, web plugin bundled with this build must be installed on user machine.
-   Flash: Assembly validation for Flash supported/unsupported API\'s. If .NET feature or API is not available the validator will notify the user in the log, before compiling.
-   Plugins: Added Texture.GetNativeTexturePtr() that you can use in native code plugins. Can now directly access textures on non-OpenGL platforms as well! Example plugin in Low-level Native Plugin Interface documentation page shows how to.

### Upgrade guide

-   We have changed how the active state of GameObjects is handled. GameObjects active state will now affect child GameObjects, so setting a GameObject to inactive will now turn the entire sub-hierarchy inactive. This may change the behavior of your projects. GameObject.active and GameObject.SetActiveRecursively() have been deprecated. Instead, you should now use the GameObject.activeSelf and GameObject.activeInHierarchy getters and the GameObject.SetActive() method.
-   Android: Removed X\<-\>Y axis mismatch for Android input. Now out of the box it should match iOS input. Requires code refactoring!
-   Editor: We have reset the preferences from 3.x to 4.x. This affects your saved window layouts, the project wizard list, saved filters etc.
-   Editor: While an asset is being imported it will not be persistent. E.g. if you postprocess a texture and query its asset path, it will return an empty string. Assets outside of the asset postprocessor can, of course, be accessed at any point.
-   iOS: Now iOS sensors follow screen orientation. No more complicated code for axis remapping! This can be switched off via Input.compensateSensors. Requires code refactoring!
-   iOS: Target Resolution Player Setting was redesigned to better suite development workflow on multiple iOS devices. Two new "Auto (Best performance)" and "Auto (Best Quality)" settings allow Unity Runtime to choose most optimal rendering resolution according to device GPU capabilities. Some custom editor scripts might need to be updated to comply with these changes. Rendering resolution might be also changed from game scripts using Screen.SetResolution API.
-   iOS: Device SDK Player Settings was simplified and now contains only two entries "Device SDK" and "Simulator SDK". Corresponding editor API entries were also changed and some custom editor scripts might need to be changed.
-   iOS: Unity 4.0 discontinues support for ARMv6 devices (iPhone 1st gen, iPhone 3G, iPod Touch 1st/2nd gen). This affects existing project development in several ways:
    -   Target Platform Player Setting was removed from Unity Editor. Now all Unity iOS applications are ARMv7-only. Corresponding PlayerSetting.iOS Editor API entries also were removed. You might need to fix some of your editor scripts for that.
    -   Graphics API level (Open GL ES 1.1 or 2.x) selection was moved to separate Graphics Level Player Setting. This setting is synced with the Android platform.
    -   Applications that were already released to the App Store as supporting ARMv6+ARMv7 or ARMv6-only now can be updated only if Target iOS Version Player Setting is set to "4.3" or higher.
-   Mobile: Unity 4.0 brings hard shadow support to mobiles. Shadows for mobiles are enabled at the default Quality Setting. And if the project is shared with desktop platforms then shadows might just appear on mobiles too when project gets imported into Unity 4.0. Some manual tweaking of lighting/shadow setup might be required for optimal performance on mobiles.
-   Runtime: GameObjects marked DontDestroyOnLoad are no longer temporarily deactivate when loading a level. They will also not receive an OnDisable / OnEnable call when loading a level.
-   Graphics: Unity 4.0 adds a \"Read/Write Enabled\" option in Mesh import settings. When this option is turned off, it saves memory since Unity can unload a copy of mesh data in the game. However, if you are scaling or instantiating meshes at runtime with a non-uniform scale, you may have to enable \"Read/Write Enabled\" in their import settings. The reason is that non-uniform scaling requires the mesh data to be kept in memory. Normally we detect this at build time, but when meshes are scaled or instantiated at runtime you need to set this manually. Otherwise they might not be rendered in game builds correctly.
-   Model importing: The Model Importer in Unity 4.0 has become better at mesh optimization. The \"Mesh Optimization\" checkbox in the Model Importer in Unity 4.0 is now enabled by default, and will reorder the vertices in your Mesh for optimal performance. You may have some post-processing code or effects in your project which depend on the vertex order of your meshes, and these might be broken by this change. In that case, turn off \"Mesh Optimization\" in the Mesh importer. Especially, if you are using the SkinnedCloth component, mesh optimization will cause your vertex weight mapping to change. So if you are using SkinnedCloth in a project imported from 3.5, you need to turn off \"Mesh Optimization\" for the affected meshes, or reconfigure your vertex weights to match the new vertex order.

### Profiler Improvements

-   Android: Profiler blocks marked up in rendering commands via EXT_debug_marker (for tools like PerfHud).
-   GPU profiler detailed objects view sorts in decreasing GPU time.
-   Optimized memory usage and UI performance for complex profiles.
-   Scripting API: Profiler.GetMonoHeapSize, GetMonoUsedSize.
-   Made profiler player connection run threaded to improve throughput and reduce lack of profile data.

### Asset Pipeline Improvements

-   Added userData string property to AssetImporter, use this to pass per asset data to asset post processor.
-   Manual asset reimport (via context menu) always reimports, even if cache server already has the result.
-   Optimized file system performance of asset imports. Library/cache and Library/previews folders are gone; all imported results are in Library/metadata.

-   iOS: Gyro and other sensors implementation moved to the trampoline. Provides more possibilities for customizations.
-   iOS: Now iOS sensors follow screen orientation. No more complicated code for axis remapping! This can be switched off via Input.compensateSensors. Requires code refactoring!
-   iOS: Removed unneeded one frame of latency (presentRenderBufer moved to the end of Repaint).
-   iOS: Added iPad Mini and iPad 4gen to iPhoneGeneration.
-   Prefabs can now have an active state which is copied to instances on instantiation.
-   Mobile: ARMv6 is not supported anymore.
-   Model Importing: Model importer no longer triangle strips but does vertex cache optimization if mesh GPU optimization is turned on. GPU optimization is turned on by default.
-   Model Importing: When using the new animation import mode, Unity will no longer attempt to move the SkinnedMeshRenderer to the root bone.
-   Native Client: NaCl is now it\'s own BuildTarget instead of a checkbox in the WebPlayer build target.
-   NavMeshAgent: Avoidance priority made consistent with e.g. audio priority: Most important = 0. Least important = 99. Default = 50. Loading older scenes will reset agent avoidance priority to new default value (50).
-   Scripting: Removed SceneView.RenderMode from Editor API(was not documented, but public). Use the documented DrawCameraMode instead.
-   Scripting: Development player emits warnings when accessing the script API from the wrong thread (or using explicit object initializers).
-   Scripting: OnEnable no longer changes the execution order of Awake. Execution order for scripts is now much more consistent. The call to OnEnable always comes immediately after Awake.
-   Substance: Added \"Bake and keep\" and \"Bake and discard\" load behaviours, to allow the baking of bitmaps on supported platforms.
-   UnityObject: Deprecated, and will no longer be used when building a WebPlayer.
-   UnityOject2: New install script when building the WebPlayer, replaces UnityObject giving more flexibility to developers.
