#### Improvements

-   Editor: When a compile error is emitted for an assembly, clear all compile errors for all assemblies that reference it directly or directly. This improves workflows when dealing with compile errors, as fixing an assembly\'s compile errors might also fix compile errors in any assemblies that reference the assembly directly or indirectly.

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

-   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.4 or higher.

-   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK

##### For running Unity games

Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

-   Desktop:

    -   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    -   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    -   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

-   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.

-   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.

-   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities

-   Exported Android Gradle projects require Android Studio 3.4 and later to build
