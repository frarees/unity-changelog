### 2020.1.17f1 Release Notes

#### System Requirements Changes

##### For running Unity games

-   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

#### Fixes

-   Asset Import: Fixed wrong pivot conversion when ResampleCurves is disabled in ModelImporter.([1283884](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animation-stutters-when-resample-curves-option-is-disabled-in-model-import-settings-animation-tab))

-   Editor: Fixed an issue where filenames could be corrupted when dragging files into the project window.([1288679](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/files-are-renamed-when-dragged-into-unity-using-file-explorer))

-   GI: Fixed crash in Enlighten::CpuUpdateManager::UpdateGpuTexture when starting GI bake after baking previous scene with GPU progressive lightmapper.([1250819](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-in-enlighten-cpuupdatemanager-updategputexture-when-starting-gi-bake-after-baking-previous-scene-with-gpu-plm))

-   GI: Fixed to make GPU lightmapper work on Apple Silicon.

-   GI: Fixed to prevent user from assigning realtimeTexture to a customProbe, and show a warning if attempted.([1243849](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-reflectionprobes-presentprobe-when-calling-reflectionprobe-dot-renderprobe-in-start-method))

-   Graphics: Fixed issue where SRP cannot know if a specific platform can do multiview rendering. It is hardcoded in for Android.\
    This will allow it to check a bool if it is possible on the platform.

-   iOS: Fixed to prevent a possible hang on shutdown after UnityWebRequest is used with TLS.([1233486](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-tvos-application-dot-quit-freezes-the-application-if-unitywebrequest-was-called))

-   Linux: Fixed to no longer export statically linked lib\'s symbols thus making it easier for plugin developers to use 3rd party libs.([1255038](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-crash-on-debugstringtofile-when-entering-play-mode-due-to-an-openssl-library-dependency))

-   Package: Fixed an issue where CinemachineBlendListCamera was incorrectly holding 0-length camera cuts.

-   Package: Fixed an issue where OnTargetObjectWarped was broken for CinemachineOrbitalTransposer.([1274989](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cinemachine-camera-stutters-when-it-has-cinemachinebrain-component-and-it-is-using-the-smart-update-method))

-   Scripting: Fixed an issue causing the incorrect ApiCompatibilityLevel to be selected when compiling C# assemblies in certain circumstances.([1252197](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/reference-to-type-vector4-claims-it-is-defined-in-system-dot-numerics-but-it-could-not-be-found-after-recompiling-scripts))

#### API Changes

-   Editor: Added: Added EditorUtility.IsRunningUnderCPUEmulation to detect whether Unity is running under CPU emulation.

#### Changes

-   Package Manager: Updated com.unity.purchasing to 2.2.1, adding full support for the implementation of GooglePlay Billing Library v3 library in the Asset Store In-App Purchasing module (includes an essential runtime hotfix over 2.2.0).

#### System Requirements

##### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

###### Additional platform development requirements:

-   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher.

-   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK

Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

-   Desktop:

    -   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    -   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    -   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

-   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.

-   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.

-   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities

-   Exported Android Gradle projects require Android Studio 3.4 and later to build
