-   Editor: Added a search field to the Console for filtering output by keyword.

-   Editor: Added checkboxes to the Gizmos menu for selecting/deselecting all gizmos in a given section (**Built-in Components**,**Scripts**, and so on).

-   Editor: Added new**EditorTools**API for creating custom tools that behave like native tools. The**Available Custom Editor Tools**button in the Scene view toolbar opens a custom tools menu. The**Component Editor Tools**panel in the Scene view shows available custom tools for the current selection.

-   Editor: Added pre-checkout and pre-submit user-specified callbacks for VCS integration.Allows users to create callbacks that can modify Asset lists and changeset selections/descriptions at checkout and submit time.

    Pre-checkout callback can:

    -   Add and remove assets from the list of those that will be checked out
    -   Create a new changeset to check the specified asset list in
    -   Nominate an existing changeset to check the specified asset list in
    -   Return false from the callback to block checkout

    Pre-submit callback can:

    -   Add and remove assets from the list of those that will be submitted
    -   Create a new changeset to submit specified asset list in
    -   Nominate an existing changeset to submit the specified asset list in
    -   Rename an existing changeset then submit it and
    -   Return false from the callback to block submission

-   Editor: Added Scene visibility controls to the Hierarchy window for controlling the visibility of GameObjects in the Scene view. Users can toggle visibility for individual GameObjects, or GameObjects and their children. A global visibility toggle hides/shows everything in the scene.

-   Editor: Made links clickable in the Console stack trace log. Clicking a link opens the source code at the line for any function calls listed in the stack.

-   Editor: Rewriting C# project files (`      .csproj     `) to disk now logs messages prefixed with`      [C# Project]     `to`      Editor.log     `. This makes it easier to determine why projects get reloaded in C# IDE\'s.

-   Editor: Script recompiles triggered by internal Unity systems now log messages prefixed with`      [ScriptCompilation]     `to`      Editor.log     `.

-   Android: More devices can use OpenSL instead of AudioTrack.This reduces audio input and output latency.

-   Animation: Added Experimental methods to AnimationPlay.

-   Animation: Added property Avatar.humanDescription.

-   Animation: Aligned all Animator StateMachine nodes on the grid.

-   Animation: Upgraded the animation window preview/playback engine to use the Playable API.

-   Asset Import: Added support for cameras in Sketchup Importer.

-   Asset Import: Extended the**Optimize Mesh**option on Model Asset import settings, to allow you to independently control optimization of Vertex Order and Polygon Order, rather than using the same flag for both. NOTE: Performance improvements to the underlying Mesh optimization code might cause Unity to generate vertices in a different order than in previous Unity versions. If you rely on vertex ordering in the optimized Mesh data (such as for vertex painting), be aware that you may need to re-generate this data.

-   Asset Import: Improved performance of DXT1/BC1 and DXT5/BC3 Texture compression This does not affect compression quality, but it does probably produce subtly different compression results.

-   Asset Pipeline: Scriptable objects that are loaded before a refresh/import, will after a refresh/import be reloaded, if the underlying asset had been modified before the refresh/import. This means that after the refresh/import scriptables objects will have the modified values from modified assets. Before this change, the scriptable object would get \"null\" value (when using operator==) after the refresh/import.

    -   Added the concept of execution flags to`       CommandBuffer      `to describe how they should execute and allow for better error handling when those command buffers are built in script. This allows for generating exceptions when adding commands not valid for async compute.
    -   Added in-Editor detection for potential GPU deadlock cases where you creates a GPU fence in one command buffer but then never execute that command buffer.

-   Editor: Added a confirmation prompt when you delete a Shortcut Profile through the Shortcut Manager.

    -   Added overloads of DrawProcedural that take an Index Buffer

-   Graphics: Unity now supports Texture Mipmap streaming in Edit Mode when**Texture Streaming**is enabled in the Editor Settings.

-   Graphics: Updated the ASTC texture compressor with faster multi-core compression.

### System Requirements

#### For development

**OS**: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

**CPU**: SSE2 instruction set support.

**GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

##### Additional platform development requirements:

-   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.4 or higher.

-   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK

#### For running Unity games

Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

-   Desktop:

    -   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 12.04+, SteamOS+
    -   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    -   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

-   iOS player requires iOS 9.0 or higher.

-   Android: OS 4.1 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support or Atom CPU; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.

-   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities
