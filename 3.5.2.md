## Release notes

### Improvements

-   iOS: Added UnityGetGLView function to AppController.mm that returns the view that unity uses
-   iOS: Splash now uses \"retina\" images if running on \"retina\" device
-   Flash: Introduced System.Attribute base type so custom attributes can at least compile cleanly.
-   Flash: It\'s now possible to invoke constructors that declare byref parameters.
-   Flash: Slightly faster Stage3D path and faster path implemented for 11.1 and 11.2 specific deploys.
-   Flash: Point filtering now works.
-   Flash: System.Bitconverter now works.
-   Flash: Dictionary.ContainsValue now works.
-   Flash: Smaller memory footprint in some cases
-   Flash: Speedup in SWFPostProcessing
-   Flash: performance optimizations on generated bytecode.
-   Flash: Byte\[\] now has a Flash native bytearray as a backing store (.elements).
-   Flash: Shallow implementation of System.Text.Encoding for ascii and utf
-   Flash: Implementations of System.Random, System.IO.MemoryStream, DateTime.Today
-   Flash: System.Exception.StackTrace property.

### Changes

-   Added Resources.UnloadAsset(Object asset) function. This is useful for unloading large individual assets if you know they are no longer used and you don\'t want to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets().
-   Editor: Introduced \[Callbacks.PostProcessBuild\] script attribute. It will execute the attributed method after the player has been built.
-   Editor: Introduced \[Callbacks.PostProcessScene\] script attribute. It will execute the attributed method when the current scene has been processed.
-   Flash: Has build targets for different FlashPlayer version 11.0, 11.1 and 11.2. No Flash Player version specific implementations exposed yet, but setting 11.2 means using a faster code path; better performance.
-   Flash: www.GetAudioClip() now works, only for non streaming mp3\'s.
-   Flash: WWW support
-   Flash: WWWForm Support
-   Flash: Assetbundle support

### Fixes

-   OS X: Fixed erratic mouse behavior with Microsoft mouse
-   Windows Player: Fixed occasional hang in multithreaded renderer when going in and out of fullscreen mode.

### Upgrade guide

In Unity 3.4 realtime lights were not affecting static objects. In Unity 3.5 realtime lights always affect static and dynamic objects.

The result of this is that if you had previously setup your lighting to work around this bug, then you will now get worse performance as you will receive the lighting twice. It will also look different since your lights will be added twice to the scene.

The correct way to use these lights is to use a single auto directional light and remove the realtime only light.

If you wish to have different realtime lighting than static lighting, you should using light culling masks to affect only dynamic objects.
