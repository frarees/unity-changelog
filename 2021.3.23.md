### 2021.3.23f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   iOS: \"Thread Performance Checker\" is now disabled by default in a generated xcode project.

-   Kernel: Performance in heavily run code paths for NativeArray, UnsafeUtility, and AtomicSafetyHandle improved through inlining.

-   Scripting: Switched some path sorting during compilation from an invariant culture compare to an ordinal compare, speeding up C# compilation when scripts are changed.

-   Serialization: Improved performance of restoring managed objects during a domain reload (again!).

-   Serialization: Improved performance of restoring managed objects during a domain reload.

-   Shadergraph: Fixed parallax nodes so that they use the default UV Input Slot correctly. \[SGB-511\].

-   Shadergraph: Improved blackboard property drag speed when reordering the blackboard. \[SGB-383\].

-   Shadergraph: Made adjustments to flipbook node to avoid dropping frames on AMD GPU. \[SGB-280\].

-   Shaders: Reduced the time spent in the asset post processing code for shader assets, which speeds-up the import of shaders.

-   VFX Graph: Greatly reduced the import cost of VFX Graph objects, especially when importing many at once.
