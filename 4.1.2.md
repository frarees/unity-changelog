## Release notes

### Features

-   Web Player: Secret information can now be injected into a running web player via Javascript, with access to that information controlled by cryptographic signatures. Security.GetChainOfTrustValue can be used to retrieve this secret information, provided that the Security object is called from an assembly whose cryptographic signature is valid and matches the signature passed in when the secret is injected. For further information, see the Manual.

### Improvements

-   Android: Stylus support .
-   UI: Windows can now be displayed modally using the GUI.ModalWindow call. Modal windows appear on top of all other Unity GUI elements and prevent interaction with all Unity GUI elements not within the modal window while open. Only one modal window can be open during a frame.
