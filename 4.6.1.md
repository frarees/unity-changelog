## Release notes

### Features

### Improvements

-   AssetBundles: Added additional information about WWW.LoadFromCacheOrDownload.
-   Graphics: Improved performance when allocating memory for large numbers of temporary objects.
-   Graphics: Optimized culling of lights in a mostly deferred scene with a few forward-rendered objects.
-   Physics 2D: Added \'Static Collider Shapes\' to profiler for 2D physics.
-   Physics 2D: Renamed Physics2D.deleteStopsCallbacks to Physics.changeStopsCallbacks to better represent its purpose (old property is now obsolete).
-   Serialization: Randomize fileIDs for objects in prefabs to lower the chance of merge conflicts.
-   UI: Encapsulate children mesh bounds when calculating Root Bounds. Also cache the value so we don\'t calculate every time we draw.
