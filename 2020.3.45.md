## Release Notes

### Known Issues in 2020.3.45f1

-   Asset Importers: The Editor hangs while opening a project when importing fbx assets([UUM-26676](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-editor-hangs-while-opening-a-project-when-importing-fbx-assets))

### 2020.3.45f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   Multiplayer: Added Netcode for GameObjects 1.2.0.

#### API Changes

-   Apple TV: Added: identifier for 3rd generation Apple TV 4K.

-   Editor: Added: Component.GetComponentInParent(Type t, bool includeInactive) method to match GameObject.([UUM-2199](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/backport-component-dot-getcomponentinparent-doesnt-have-an-overload-for-getting-components-of-inactive-objects))

-   iOS: Added: identifiers for iPad models released in 2022.

-   Scripting: Added: New Object.FindFirstObjectByType() and Object.FindAnyObjectByType() functions added as potentially faster alternatives to Object.FindObjectOfType(). These new functions let you decide whether you must have the first (lowest InstanceID) object found or if any instance is adequate. In the latter case the function can be many times faster as no internal sorting is required. See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.

-   Scripting: Added: New Object.FindObjectsByType() function added as a potentially faster alternative to Object.FindObjectsOfType(). This new function gives users the choice whether or not to perform the expensive sorting by InstanceID on the returned collection of objects rather than having it always performed wasting time when unnecessary. See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType() and Object.FindObjectsOfType() for more details.

-   Version Control: Removed: Collab and its dependency from the package.
