### 2022.1.19f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   Core: Added Transform.SetLocalPositionAndRotation(). This allows you to set both the localPosition and localRotation of a transform in a single call, which is more efficient than assigning to localPosition and localRotation separately. (Thank you to \@DevDunk on the forum for the request!).

-   Shadergraph: Reduced time taken by code generation when a shader graph asset is imported.

-   VFX Graph: Reduced time taken by code generation when a VFX asset is imported.

#### Changes

-   Burst: Entry point functions weren\'t always included in crash callstacks; now they are.

#### Fixes

-   Android: Fixed overflow of MotionEvent global references.([UUM-8438](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-crash-in-player-due-to-an-overflow-of-global-references-to-android-dot-view-dot-motionevent))

-   Burst: ;\'s in paths would cause burst to fail. Note - Also requires a fix in the Editor, so if your project has ;\'s in its path, the workaround is to remove the ; from the folder name for now.

-   Burst: An Internal Compiler Error that could occur if a function that requires a struct ret (due to ABI) has been discarded by other logic.

-   Burst: Corrupted binary could be produced on M1 if there was not enough space for UUID+codesign injection.

-   Burst: Disabling Burst from the command line via` --burst-disable-compilation `no longer results in Burst errors when building a player for Android.

-   Burst: Fixed a bug in Burst player builds where sufficiently complicated Bursted code could cause a deadlock deep within LLVM.

-   Burst: Fixed a bug where static fields in generic types could in some situations be initialized with the incorrect value.

-   Burst: Fixed a bug with locally declared array variables in functions where storing` null `into them could cause invalid codegen.

-   Burst: Fixed a safety check bug with` Span `/` ReadOnlySpan `and` Slice(start, length) `where if` start `+` length `was equal to the` Length `of the original span, the safety check would incorrectly report an out-of-bounds access.

-   Burst: Fixed access violation race condition bug.

-   Burst: Fixed error that occurs with a specific formulation of IL, using xx with an early out escape and unbalanced calculation stack. (Object reference not set to an instance of \... in CollectBlock.ToVisitOrder).

-   Burst: Fixed error when compiling assemblies with spaces in their names.

-   Burst: Fixed that UWP builds wouldn\'t respect the specified \"Target SDK Version\" and \"Visual Studio Version\" settings.

-   Burst: Interface methods where not being hashed correctly for constrained types, which would result in burst failing to recompile code that had changed in an implementation class.

-   Burst: Linking issue when exports differ only by module.

-   Editor: Corrected the build of a Mac Standalone player with an exported Xcode project when script debugging is enabled.([UUM-11352](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-xcode-build-fails-when-building-an-exported-project-with-script-debugging-enabled))
