### 2022.2.5f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   EmbeddedLinux: Now enabled via BootConfig parameters, Editor Setting and has a scripting entrypoint.

#### API Changes

-   HDRP: Added: DecalShaderGraphGUI.SetupDecalKeywordsAndPass - Adding back a public API used to validate shadergraph materials by user scripts.

-   Scripting: Added: Object.FindFirstObjectByType() and Object.FindAnyObjectByType() functions added as potentially faster alternatives to Object.FindObjectOfType(). These new functions let you decide whether you must have the first (lowest InstanceID) object found or if any instance is adequate. In the latter case the function can be many times faster as no internal sorting is required. See the scripting documentation for both functions for more details.

-   Scripting: Added: Object.FindObjectsByType() function added as a potentially faster alternative to Object.FindObjectsOfType(). This new function gives users the choice whether or not to perform the expensive sorting by InstanceID on the returned collection of objects rather than having it always performed wasting time when unnecessary. See the scripting documentation for Object.FindObjectsByType() and Object.FindObjectsOfType() for more details.

#### Changes

-   Documentation: Added documentation for public-facing methods:\
