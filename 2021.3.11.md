### 2021.3.11f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Added bone weight index validation in SpriteSkin\'s validate method, to ensure valid data before continuing with deformation.

-   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Updated Toolbar and Visibility tab buttons\' selection color.

-   2D: \[com.unity.2d.common\] Added support for different sized texture inputs in ImagePacker.
