## Release Notes

## 5.5.0f3 Release Notes (Full)

### System Requirements Changes

-   OSX 10.8 support is deprecated and will be dropped in the near future. OSX 10.9 and above is therefore recommended.
-   Samsung TV 2013 and 2014 support will be dropped in the near future.

### Features

-   Animation: Animation Window box tool. This allows far simpler moving, scaling, and even ripple editing ("r" hotkey) of keyframes in both Dopesheet and Curves.
-   Audio: Added support for Microsoft Research Head Related Transfer Function (Spatial Sound) targeting Windows 10 and UWP. This HRTF solution can be used for any Windows 10 application and works best with VR/AR and head tracked headphones.
-   Editor: High Detail view in the CPU Profiler Timeline. Shows all profiler samples without filtering.
-   Editor: Native memory allocation profiling in CPU Profiler Timeline. Shows call stacks of native memory allocations.
-   Editor: New selection highlighting in scene view. Instead of showing a wireframe a selection outline is now shown. This outline color can be configured in the preferences of Unity. In the gizmo / annotation window you can select if you would like this behavour, the old behaviour, or both.
-   Editor: Option to run Cache Server locally for quick platform switching.
-   Graphics: Added support for BC4,BC5,BC6,BC7 compressed texture formats, and RGBAHalf format. These formats are supported on PC (DX11+, GL4, Metal) and consoles (PS4, XboxOne).
    -   BC6H for high quality compressed RGB HDR textures.
    -   BC7 for high quality compressed RGB(A) textures.
    -   HDR Textures and Reflection Probes now default to FP16 for uncompressed, and BC6H for compressed textures on PC/console platforms.
    -   BC7 is chosen automatically by the Texture Importer for textures set up as \"High Quality Compressed\" on supported platforms (see Texture Importer documentation).
    -   Note: DX9 and Mac GL do not support BC6/BC7 formats. If a Texture is set as BC6H, it is automatically uncompressed to FP16. If a Texture is set as BC7, it is automatically uncompressed to RGBA8.
    -   BC4 and BC5 formats can be used manually for single and two-channel texture compression on PC/console platforms. These formats are available even on DX9.
-   Graphics: Added support for cubemap arrays (CubemapArray C# class). Similar to Texture2DArray, this is a graphics feature that lets the GPU access a bunch of same size/format cubemaps as a unit, index into them when sampling, and other related tasks. Cubemap arrays are a desktop and console class feature, supported on DX10.1+/GL4.0+ on PC, and on PS4/XB1.
-   Graphics: Linear color space is supported on Android with OpenGL ES 3.x and iOS with Metal.
-   Graphics: New (Preview) LookDev editor window for viewing & validating meshes and materials in various lighting environments.
-   Graphics: Unity splash screen tools.
-   Particles: Added support for sending custom data to Particle System vertex Shaders.
-   Particles: New Modules:
    -   Lights Module, for adding realtime lights to particles
    -   Noise Module, for adding Curl Noise to Particle Movement
    -   Trails Module, for rendering ribbonized trails behind particles
-   Physics: New CapsuleCollider2D.
-   Scripting: Built-in support for opening scripts in[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)as an external script editor on Windows and macOS. Unity will now detect when Visual Studio Code is selected an external script editor and pass the correct arguments to it when opening scripts from Unity and setup a default .vscode/settings.json with file excludes, if it does not already exist.
-   Shaders: Per-rendertarget blend modes. New shader syntax: \"Blend N Src Dst\", \"BlendOp N Op\", \"ColorMask Mask N\", where N is the render target index (0..7). This feature works on DX11/12, GLCore, Metal, PS4.
-   VR: HoloLens support graduated from the Technical Preview!
-   VR: In-Editor holographic emulation

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

-   Audio: If previously using a Unity Hololens technical preview release with the Microsoft HRTF spatializer and the Audio Spatializer script component, said component now only controls room size properties. Distance-based attenuation is now set up in the AudioSource script component, so the Spatial Blend property needs to be set to 1.0 and the 3D Sound Settings need to be set appropriately.
-   Core: Using Object.Instantiate(Object, Transform) will now use the Object position as the local position by default. This is a change from the 5.4 behaviour, which used the Object position as world.
-   Editor: Time.deltaTime now updates in the Editor for any script marked with \[ExecuteInEditMode\], or any MonoBehaviour that has runInEditMode set to true.
-   OpenGL: Legacy desktop OpenGL2 support has been removed. It had already been removed as the default option in Unity in 5.3, and deprecated in Unity 5.4. This only affects Mac & Linux.
-   Scripting: EditorJsonUtility now serializes object references by assetGUID/fileID rather than InstanceID, making the serialized data stable across Editor sessions.
-   Shaders: DX9 half-pixel offset adjustments are now done at Shader compilation time. This means that shaders no longer need to do any UNITY_HALF_TEXEL_OFFSET checks, and any possible C# code for coordinate adjustment no longer needs to happen on DX9. However, vertex Shader constant register #255 (c255) is now reserved by Unity, and all vertex shaders get two instructions automatically added to do the adjustment.
-   WebGL: Removed support for loading LZMA compressed AssetBundles, as LZMA decompression is too slow for WebGL.

### Changes

-   Editor: Building a player will now fail if the project does not build in the Editor.
-   Editor: Reflection Probe: \"Probe Origin\" has been renamed to \"Box Offset\", and \"Size\" to \"Box Size\" in the Inspector UI.
-   Editor: Removed fading/lerping behaviour when dragging/docking views, for a cleaner and less visually confusing UI.
-   GI: Deprecated the directional specular lightmap mode in Unity 5.5, since it will disappear in Unity 5.6 (as part of the lighting modes functionality).
-   Graphics: A fatal error is now shown if the Unity player is forced to run with a graphics API that it wasn\'t built for in the Editor.
-   Graphics: Removed logic that used guesswork to downscale shadow resolution based on how much free VRAM was available at the time.
-   Graphics: Rendering Path settings have been moved from*Project Settings*\>*Player*to*Project Settings*\>*Graphics*.
-   Graphics: The default uncompressed texture format is now RGBA32 on all platforms, and the default format for new Texture2D script API. Previously, ARGB32 was the default on some platforms, but RGBA32 is better because it needs less color channel re-ordering at Texture upload time.
-   Graphics: Warnings are now shown when a Renderer that statically batched is going to be rendered instanced.
-   Physics: The breakForce reported by the OnJointBreak callback is now the original breakForce, regardless of whether the Joint was disabled and re-enabled during the callback cycle.
-   Physics: The physics system now rejects Meshes containing non-finite vertices.
-   Profiler: User profile markers in scripts now show in platform-specific profiling tools even when the Unity profiler is not running.
-   Samsung TV: Support for 2013 and 2014 Samsung TVs has been dropped. Deploying to these two years of TV no longer works.
-   VR: Oculus Touch Controllers and Oculus Remote now present themselves as standard joysticks.
-   VR: OpenVR controllers now present themselves as standard joysticks.
-   WebGL: asm.js code is now written in a separate file for normal JS, which allows for better memory optimizations in Firefox.

### Improvements

-   Android: Enabled TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 for JellyBean and KitKat devices.
-   Android: Enhanced big.LITTLE core detection. This fixes core detection on Parker.
-   Android: IL2CPP: Stripping of symbols and debug info is now enabled by default. Development builds still have symbols, which makes for a slightly larger binary.
-   Android: IL2CPP: The full debug version of IL2CPP libraries are now stored in Temp/StagingArea/Il2Cpp/Native.
-   Android: Symbols for release libraries are now available in PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Variantions/\*/Release/Symbols.
-   Animation: Added a new default ClipAnimationMaskType \"None\" to the Animation Importer. Use this value when you do not need a mask.
-   Animation: Implemented Reset for BlendTrees.
-   Animation: Import avatar improvements: A warning is now generated when importing avatar configurations with hierarchies that do not match properly. These configurations continue to work, but do need to be updated with a proper avatar configuration. This update also includes improvements to the default auto-mapping.
-   Animation: In the Clip Importer, AvatarMask is now set to \"None\" by default when importing new FBX files.
-   Build Pipeline: AssetBundles now work with engine code stripping. A custom player build can understand which AssetBundles will be loaded by the player at run time, and determine which parts of the engine code those AssetBundles need to preserve. See BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer method change for more information.
-   Build Pipeline: Optimized the build pipeline so that AssetBundles which contain Scene files don\'t need to recompile the scripts every time. This results in a much quicker build process.
-   Cache Server: Upgraded the node.js version used by the Cache Server to version 0.12.7.
-   Collaboration: Various bug fixes and UI improvements.
-   Editor: Added \'Discard changes\' in Scene context menu in the Hierarchy. This reloads selected modified Scenes from disk.
-   Editor: Added support for resizing the height of the Preferences window.
-   Editor: Added undo support for Sorting Layers.
-   Editor: Added Unity version to the main Unity Editor window title bar, making it easy to see which Unity version you currently have open.
-   Editor: Area lights now indicate their effective range in the Inspector.
-   Editor: EditorGUIUtility.ObjectContent now adds type information to the text string as shown for ObjectFields. For example: \"Concrete (Texture2D)\" instead of \"Concrete\".
-   Editor: In SceneView, the wireframe is now hidden on objects with the hideInHierarchy flag. Previously it would still be visible when the object\'s parent was selected.
-   Editor: It is now possible to dock views to the tops of windows and other views. Previously only left, right and bottom were possible.
-   Editor: The Game View now has the option to emulate low resolution for aspect ratios when on a retina monitor, using a checkbox at the top of the Aspect Ratio/Resolution menu. This update applied to macOS-only, because retina support is currently macOS-only.
-   Editor: Unity now treats quotes in the .exe path in the same way the Windows command line does.
-   Editor: Windows Editor now remembers the directory where a project was last created, and defaults to that location rather than the directory of the last opened project.
-   GI: MaterialPropertyBlocks are now applied for Realtime GI Meta pass rendering.
-   Graphics: Added a Texture Mode to the Line/Trail Renderers, to control whether the texture repeats or stretches.
-   Graphics: Added Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced and CommandBuffer.DrawMeshInstanced API, allowing instanced draws without the overhead of creating thousands of renderers.
-   Graphics: Added RenderTexture.GenerateMips script API for manual control over mipmap generation. Renamed existing RenderTexture.generateMips property to autoGenerateMips.
-   Graphics: Added the ability to batch Renderers of different LOD fade values together by using the \"lodfade\" option in the instancing_options directive.
-   Graphics: Command buffers attached to Lights are now visualised in the Inspector, and buttons have been added for removing each/all of them.
-   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Added support for Android with OpenGL ES 3.0 or newer, and iOS/macOS with Metal. Note that instancing is disabled on Android devices with GLES3.0 Adreno GPUs.
-   Graphics: GPU Instancing: Implemented SpeedTree instancing. Light Probes are still not allowed.
-   Graphics: Improve shadows precision for large game worlds. Use reverse-float depth buffer for improved depth buffer precision on modern GPUs. Particularly improves directional light shadowing for large view distances.​
-   Graphics: Improved in-editor graphics emulation:
    -   Metal setting added, used by default on iOS/tvOS (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
    -   OpenGL ES 3.0 setting added, used by default on Android (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
    -   WebGL 1 and WebGL 2 settings added; WebGL1 used by default on WebGL (instead of previous GLES2.0 setting).
    -   Shader Model 4 setting added, available on Standalone/Windows Store.
-   Graphics: Improved Line/Trail Renderer handling of corners and gradients.
-   Graphics: Improved LODGroup component UI:
    -   The sliding Camera icon is now aware of the global LOD bias value, and works accordingly.
    -   The \"Recalculate Bounds\" button is now only enabled when clicking it will result in a change.
-   Graphics: Metal (iOS/macOS) can now render into slices of 3D and 2DArray Textures.
-   Graphics: Metal: Switched the shader backend to[HLSLcc](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/HLSLcc). This is the same compiler used for OpenGL Core and ES3.0. Now it enables instancing, and soon compute shaders on Metal.
-   Graphics: Multi-Scene occlusion culling now works correctly. Culling data has been extracted to a separate Asset, and can be baked/reloaded with multi-Scene setups. Note that the data is stored relative to the active Scene, and is loaded correctly when loading any Scene or group of Scenes that reference it.
-   Graphics: Shader.globalMaximumLOD is now restored after exiting Play Mode.
-   Graphics: Static batch rendering is now faster, and uses fewer draw calls in many cases.
-   IL2CPP: Reduce the binary size and build time for projects which make use of many C# attributes.
-   IMGUI: The Event.Use() function logs a warning if the event type is Repaint or Layout.
-   iOS: Added a way for the user to retrieve Game Center authentication error strings.
-   iOS: Added an option for users to disable the filtering of emojis in the iOS keyboard via the trampoline code.
-   iOS: Fixed audio ducking for iOS platform (background audio applications muting).

-   OSX/iOS Metal: Added -force-metal switch to force Metal rendering on OSX/iOS.
-   Particles: Added \"Show Bounds\" to Particle System UI. This shows the world and local AABB for the system.
-   Particles: Added a new Render mode to make particle billboards face the eye position. This is good for VR rendering.
-   Particles: Added a new Shape Module option to rotate particles to face their initial direction of travel.
-   Particles: Gradients now support a fixed color mode, where no blending is performed. This is useful when users want to define a simple list of possible colors to be chosen from.
-   Particles: Gravity Modifier can now be a curve over time.
-   Particles: Improved the Particle System curve editor so that it now supports wrap modes, and improved selection and editing of keys.
-   Physics: Added more performance metrics to the Physics profiler.
-   Physics: All Effector inspector editors now use animated roll-outs to group properties.
-   Physics: Exposed Physics.queriesHitBackfaces. This is disabled by default, so all physics queries do*not*detect hits with backface triangles. Previously, some queries would detect and some wouldn\'t, which was inconsistent.
-   Physics: Physics engine updated from PhysX 3.3.1 to PhysX 3.3.3.
-   Physics: Physics2D settings now have the option to show Collider2D AABB in the Gizmo roll-out.
-   Physics: Rigidbody2D and Collider2D Inpsector editors now have an \"Info\" roll-out showing useful information.
-   Physics: Rigidbody2D now accepts a PhysicsMaterial2D, which is then used for all attached Collider2Ds that don\'t specify their own.
-   Plugins: You can exclude specific platforms when \"Any Platform\" is selected. This allows you to set plug-in compatibilities on any platform except your selected specific platform. Added additional API to PluginImporter.
-   SamsungTV: Added support for deploying to multiple Samsung TVs at once. Separate TV IPs with a forward slash to do this.
-   Scripting: EditorJsonUtility now allows any object type to be passed in for serialization, not just UnityEngine.Object types. This means vanilla C# types can take advantage of the object reference serialization behaviour.
-   Scripting: Improved the performance of System.IO.StringReader.ReadLine.
-   Scripting: JsonUtility.ToJson is now faster and uses less temporary memory.
-   Scripting: On macOS, the Unity Editor no longer starts BugReporter on Null exceptions when in batch mode.
-   Scripting: Upgraded C# compiler to Mono 4.4. The new compiler still targets C# 4 and .NET 3.5, but provides better performance and many bug fixes.
-   Serialization: Added new scripting class attribute \'PreferBinarySerialization\' which allows developers to hint Unity that a ScriptableObject derived type prefers to use binary serialization regardless of project\'s asset serialization mode.
-   Serialization: The serialization depth limit warning now prints the serialization hierarchy that triggered the warning.
-   Services: Game Performance service; added option to prevent exceptions that occur in Play mode (in the Editor) from being reported.
-   Shaders: Added a Render Queue setting to the Material UI. Previously this was a script-only setting on the Material.
-   Shaders: Fixed various half-pixel offset issues when using Direct3D 9. Rendering now exactly matches other platforms (such as DX11, OpenGL).
-   Shaders: Improved exception messages when passing invalid arguments to the ComputeShader constructor.
-   Shaders: Improved memory usage for large Shaders compiled for multiple APIs. Only the active API\'s data will be decompressed in the player.
-   Shaders: Improved usability of \"Show compiled code\" for Shaders. Now compiled Shader variants are grouped together in a more useful way.
-   Shaders: Increased the number of allowed shader keywords to 256 (up from 128). Optimized related parts of the code, so it\'s often actually faster now.
-   Shaders: Renamed variables and cleaned code in UnityStandardBRDF.cginc. See 5.5 upgrade guide for details.
-   Shaders: Shaders are now exported to the Unity player completely in binary. There is no Shader text string and parsing in run time.
-   Shaders: When Shader compilation fails and the reason is unknown, the error output from the platform Shader compiler is now shown in the error message.
-   Terrain: Terrain LOD pre-computation is optimized and now runs faster (specifically, TerrainData.SetHeights and setting the size property are faster now).
-   Unity Ads: Updated Unity Ads to v2.0.5. Fixed crashes related to calling user-defined callbacks from outside the main Unity thread.
-   Version Control: Major improvements to memory and CPU usage.
-   Visual Studio: Added cancel button to \"Opening Visual Studio\" progress dialog.
-   VisualStudio: COM is no longer used to launch VisualStudio. This results in a faster VisualStudio startup time.
-   VR: GUI elements now work with single-pass stereo rendering
-   VR: UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalRotation() and UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalPosition() can now be used to query the position and orientation of Oculus Touch and HTC Vive controllers.
-   VR: Updated the native plug-in support for VR devices. Plug-ins in user projects override native VR plugins when used.
-   WebGL: Aded the option to use Brotli compression instead of Gzip.
-   WebGL: Rebuilds which don\'t change code now cache the complete JS build, resulting in much faster iteration times.
-   WebGL: Reduced the size of release builds by stripping away duplicate functions.
-   WebGL: WebGL 2.0 is now enabled by default for new projects.
-   Windows Standalone: Added the \"Copy PDB files\" option to the Build Settings window. PDB files are large, but useful for profiling or crash debugging.
-   Windows Standalone: Windows Standalone applications can now correctly run in[low integrity mode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625960.aspx).
-   Windows Store: Added a \"Copy References\" option in the Build Settings window. This allows for generated solutions to reference Unity files from the Unity installation folder, instead of copying them to an exported folder. This can save up to 10 GB of disk space. Note that you can\'t copy the exported folder to another PC, because there is a dependency on Unity\'s installation folder.
-   Windows Store: Added new option for input handling in XAML-based applications: pointer input can now be recieved from SwapChainPanel. This is an alternative to independent input sources.
-   Windows Store: Added partial hardware cursor support. The default cursor set in PlayerSettings acts as a hardware cursor. Cursors set at runtime still act as software cursors. See Cursor documentation for more information.
-   Windows Store: Added the concept of \"target device type\", which allows you to target only one family of devices (such as PC, mobile or HoloLens). This enables better resource optimization for a particular device type. See documentation on EditorUserBuildSettings.wsaSubtarget for more information.
-   Windows Store: Assembly C# projects are now generated next to the main solution in the GeneratedProjects folder.
-   Windows Store: Expanded UnityEngine.WSA.Cursor.SetCustomCursor. If you pass 0 to this function, it will restore the cursor to arrow icon.
-   Windows Store: New implementation for TouchScreenKeyboard on UWP. XAML and D3D apps are now supported, as well as IME input. To turn on older implementation, pass the command line argument -forceTextBoxBasedKeyboard.
-   Windows Store: Windows Store platform no longer appears in the Build Settings window if the Editor is not running on Windows.

### Known Issues

-   Android: Auto rotation causes rendering artifacts on Android 4.1 and older (854739)
-   Asset Import: Modifying importer settings from script produces a non-deterministic texture asset representation, which may result in a performance drop (unnecessary reimports) for projects using version control or cache sever. Fix expected shortly in a patch release. (856344)
-   Editor: Asset bundle building performance decrease when building multiple small asset bundles. (849376)
-   Editor: OSX: Launcher window cannot be closed when opening it via \'Account-\>Sign in\' in Editor. (836131)
-   Editor: Play mode performance regression on Windows. Fix expected shortly in a patch release. (848131)
-   GI: In Editor, light does reflect off static objects when Baked GI is used with mobile platforms selected. Note that the issue is not present when the project is deployed to a device. Fix expected shortly in a patch release. (849671)
-   Graphics: Camera.SetReplacementShader renders objects affected by projectors even when the tag does not match. (840141)
-   Graphics: GPU profiling is not supported in macOS Editor (works in Standalone player builds). (823371)
-   Graphics: GPU profiling is not supported when graphics jobs are enabled. (802273)
-   Graphics: Occlusion Culling: Editor crashes when reading a scene with occlusion culling from an asset bundle. Player builds are not affected and work fine. Fix is expected shortly in a patch release. (846853)
-   Particles: MacOS: Destroy() with particle system object in IEnumerator Start() causes crash. (855467)
-   Physics: CapsuleCollider might penetrate a scaled MeshCollider if it stands exactly on an edge of the mesh in PCM collision detection mode. Workaround: disable PCM (uncheck Edit -\> Project Settings -\> Physics -\> Enable PCM). Fix coming shortly in a patch. (850059)
-   Physics: Using a Transform scale in X or Y or zero with a CapsuleCollider2D added will cause a crash. Fixed in the first 5.5.0 patch. (853163)
-   UI: Undocked windows are placed behind the main window after assembly reload. (846877)
-   VR: Single-pass deferred rendering with multiple cameras in a scene results in the scene being rendered upside down. (851910)

## 5.5.0f3 Release Notes (Delta since f2/RC2)

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

-   Audio: If previously using a Unity Hololens technical preview release with the Microsoft HRTF spatializer and the Audio Spatializer script component, said component now only controls room size properties. Distance-based attenuation is now set up in the AudioSource script component, so the Spatial Blend property needs to be set to 1.0 and the 3D Sound Settings need to be set appropriately.

## The following are changes and fixes to 5.5.0 features and regressions\...
