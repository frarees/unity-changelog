This means the Rigidbody will view positive angles as going clockwise around the Joint anchor. The HingeJoint \"Connected Body\" will view the Joint anchor as a right-hand coordinate system. This means the Connected Body will view positive angles as going counter-clockwise around the Joint anchor.
-   Physics: Obsoleted enum JointDriveMode and JointDrive.mode
-   Physics: When changing a mesh and subsequently setting it as the sharedMesh of a MeshCollider we now update collision mesh instead of ignoring the changes.

-   Editor: Don\'t show disabled context button for assets without a context menu
-   Editor: EditorGUIUtility.RenderGameViewCameras() marked obsolete. It was poorly designed API, and it appears nobody uses it anyway. We\'ll give it at least one minor release until we remove it entirely, in order to see if anyone is actually using it.
-   Editor: The minimum OS requirement for Unity Editor on Windows was raised to Windows 7. Windows Standalone: The minimum OS requirement for the Windows Standalone stayed the same (Windows XP SP2+).
-   Editor:Screen.lockCursor will not be reset when clicking with mouse

-   Physics: Restore the Rigidbody2D linear-velocity after a Rigidbody2D.MovePosition has completed.
-   Physics: Setting Rigidbody.detectCollisions to false also affects queries now (e.g. Physics.RaycastAll)
-   Terrain: \"SplatCount\" tag is removed from terrain shaders as it doesn\'t serve any purpose..
-   UI: Updated function names to be more consistent with other classes
-   Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8: Removed support for Windows Phone 8.0 and Windows Store Apps 8.0

### The following are changes and fixes to 5.3 features and regressions\...

### Improvement

-   IL2CPP: Allow null checks, array bounds checks, and divide by zero checks to be selectively included or omitted from generated C++ code by using a C# attribute on type, method, or property definitions.
-   iOS/IL2CPP: Enable incremental build support using the \"Append\" option. Keep the generated code stable across additional, removal, and changes for string literals and non-generic types.

### Fixes

-   Editor: Fix right arrow expansion in Tree Views
-   Editor: Stop recording animation when a new GameObject is selected in the hierarchy (Animation Window)
-   GI: Fixed crash when switching to clustering scene view modes.
-   IL2CPP: Convert assemblies that are mentioned in a link.xml file but are not referenced by any other assemblies at compile time.
-   IL2CPP: During byte code stripping, preserve any nested types inside an outer type that has the \[Preserve\] attribute.
-   IL2CPP: Prevent an intermittent hang with asynchronous sockets.
-   iOS: Fixed full-screen playback of non-supported video file hanging app
-   iOS: Fixed inability to programatically hide controls in full-screen video when AVKit was used
-   Terrain: Fixed crash when using SpeedTree wind with SpeedTree trees painted on terrain.
-   Windows Store: master configuration now builds when using IL2CPP scripting backend.
