### 2022.2.3f1 Release Notes

#### Improvements

-   Animation: Improved performance of AnimatorOverrideController.ApplyOverrides().([UUM-14753](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/significant-impact-on-performance-when-using-animator-override-controller))

#### API Changes

-   Core: Added: Gizmos.DrawLineList() API which allow a sequence of disconnected lines to be drawn with a single API call improving performance over repeated calls to Gizmos.DrawLine().

-   Core: Added: Gizmos.DrawLineStrip() API which allow a sequence of connected lines to be drawn with a single API call improving performance over repeated calls to Gizmos.DrawLine().

-   Core: Added: Several new batch Transform APIs that can process multiple points or vectors in a single API call rather than having to make repeated calls on each point in turn which drastically improves performance\
    Transform.TransformPoints() - batch version of Transform.TransformPoint()\
    Transform.TransformDirections() - batch version of Transform.TransformDirection()\
    Transform.TransformVectors() - batch version of Transform.TransformVector()\
    Transform.InverseTransformPoints() - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformPoint()\
    Transform.InverseTransformDirections() - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformDirection()\
    Transform.InverseTransformVectors() - batch version of Transform.InverseTransformVector().

-   Core: Added: Use these new methods for improved performance when operating on both positions and rotations at the same time.\
    Transform.GetLocalPositionAndRotation()\
    Transform.GetPositionAndRotation()\
    TransformAccess.GetLocalPositionAndRotation()\
    TransformAccess.GetPositionAndRotation()\
