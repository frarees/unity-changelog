### 2021.2.1f1 Release Notes

#### API Changes

-   Shaders: Added: Added a possibility to query preprocessed shader data for a given variant([1364378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/no-way-to-get-preprocessed-data-using-pass-dot-compilevariant))

#### Fixes

-   Android: Further improve build times, when sequential build is done with no changes in project. Previously Unity was moving apk/aab from gradle project to final location, thus forcing the gradle to rebuild apk/aab on sequential builds, Unity will perform a copy instead now. Our tests show that sequential build times improved by 50%, for ex., dropping from 12 seconds to 5 seconds.(1361602)

-   Android: Workaround a problem where using logcat would leak pipes on OSX. The underlying problem seems to be with C# Process class, where if you redirect streams and dispose process, the pipes would remain opened. This will be investigated separatly.([1303618](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-adb-functionality-leaks-a-pipe-causes-too-many-open-files-error))

-   Animation: Fixed an issue where an assert was triggered upon rebuilding an animation legacy component.([1330001](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-m-curves-when-playing-animation-after-reenabling-object))

-   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where MonoScripts in plugins that were dependent on plugins in other folders could fail to import when reimporting all assets.([1345854](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mono-scripts-in-dlls-fail-to-import-when-reimporting-all-assets))

-   Asset Pipeline: Improved opening time of Import Activity Window.([1343709](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/import-activity-window-takes-long-time-to-open))

-   Audio: Fixed exposing multiple send levels in the audio mixer not working correctly. Note: previously created mixers with exposed send levels will cause a warning to be logged on editor startup and the send levels will have to be re-exposed.([1285638](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-mixer-unable-to-expose-other-send-level-parameters-when-one-is-already-exposed))

-   Editor: Fixed windows editor sometimes getting into a \"script assemblies are locked\" state after invoking a modal dialog from a C# script.([1367358](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-asemblies-get-locked-when-trying-to-recompile-after-opening-and-closing-openfolderpanel-window))
