#### Changes

-   Package Manager: Changed the package installation process to no longer set package directories and files as read-only on disk. This prevents all sorts of possible corruption scenarios (e.g. read-only directories, partially-read-only packages in the package cache) and avoids some permission issues when removing packages.

-   Package Manager: Changed the package installation process to systematically revert packages to their original state.**Note:**this has the side-effect of actively reverting local modifications in immutable packages, which could previously be kept until the dependency was updated to a different version of the package. In order to preserve local changes, a package should first be \[embedded in the project\](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-embed.html).

#### Improvements

-   Package Manager: Added support for configuring additional SSL certificate authorities, including self-signed certificates. See the \[Unity Manual\](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-network.html#SSL) for more information on how to use this.

-   Package Manager: Added support for Git URLs with the SCP format (e.g.` git@github.com/user/repo `).

-   Package Manager: Added support for Git URLs without a trailing` .git `by using` git:// `URLs or prepending` git+ `to URLs (e.g.` git+https://github.com/user/repo `).

-   Package Manager: Added support for tarball-based dependencies (e.g.` "file:.tgz" `).

-   Package Manager: Changed the` UnityEditor.PackageManager.Client.Add `method to make the` @ `prefix optional when adding Git-based dependencies and local dependencies (` file: `).

-   Package Manager: Reduced the amount of data transferred over the network when fetching package metadata from the registry.

#### Features

-   Multiplayer: Added UNET encryption support.
