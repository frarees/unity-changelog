## Release notes

## 2017.2.0f3 Release Notes (Full. Diff from f2 at end)

### System Requirements Changes

-   Removed iOS 6.0 support. The minimum supported version is now 7.0.

### Features

-   2D: Added Tilemap.

-   Asset Import: Added support for animated custom properties from FBX.

-   Asset Import: Added support for Stingray material import from FBX.

-   GI: Added per-object lightmap seam stitching for Progressive Lightmapper.

-   GI: Added profiler for Realtime Global Illumination.

-   GI: Added support for double-sided materials in Progressive Lightmapper. Added a new Material setting that causes lighting to interact with backfaces. When enabled, both sides of the geometry get accounted for when calculating Global Illumination. Backfaces do not count as invalid when seen from other GameObjects. Backface rendering is not controlled by this setting, and backfaces are not represented in the lightmaps. Backfaces bounce light using the same emission and albedo as frontfaces.

-   GI: Added support for per-object casting and receiving shadows in the Progressive Lightmapper. For \"Cast Shadows\", only the \"On\" and \"Off\" options are currently supported.

-   Graphics: Implemented Display-P3 color gamut support for iOS and macOS. Added \"Color Gamut\" property to Player Settings, which will eventually cover other platforms with wide color gamut support.

-   Multiplayer: Added new QoS options for delivery of large messages: reliable or unreliable, and un-ordered (fragmented) or ordered (fragmented sequenced).

-   OSX: Added support for Retina in macOS standalone builds.

-   Package Manager: Exposed the API for enabling internal components to be updated more frequently than the Editor. This is the first step in implementing the Unity Package Manager. We are taking an incremental approach to integrate the system into the Unity ecosystem. It will grow with more features over time. For this first release, we have avoided exposing user-facing features.

-   Particles: Added \"Stop Action\" option to allow Particle Systems to be destroyed or disabled when they finish playing.

-   Particles: Added Linear Drag support for Particles. The new options are in the Limit Velocity over Lifetime Module.

-   Services: Performance Reporting Service: Added support for native crashes on Android.

-   Timeline: Added support for Avatar Masks on Animation Tracks.

-   Video: Added pixel aspect ratio support for non-square pixels.

-   WebGL: Added linear rendering to WebGL 2.0

-   XR: Added openVR support for Mac 64bit application target that use Metal graphics.

-   XR: Added support for certain aspects of the Vive HMD to be simulated in-Editor without the need of a physical HMD. To enable this, use the \"Mock HMD - Vive\" virtual reality SDK in the Player Settings. The mock HMD uses the same asymmetric projection matrix, hidden occlusion mesh, field of view, aspect ratio, and eye texture size as the Vive. You can use mock HMD with both multi and single pass rendering paths. It renders as a split-screen stereo display in the Editor.

-   XR: Added support for Google ARCore augmented reality technology when targeting Android 7.0 and above on supported devices. See[our blog post for more information and how to get started](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/08/29/ar-comes-to-android-with-the-arcore-sdk/)

-   XR: Added support for Video Async Reprojection for Daydream View. Video Async Reprojection allows an app to feed video frames directly into the Google VR Async Reprojection system without going through the main Unity render loop. This provides a fast path to direct rendering of video, regardless of the current frame rate Unity is rendering at and skips Texture filtering, providing for a much higher quality output. There is also an option to allow for the use of protected memory, for users that need to render DRM-protected content.

-   XR: Added support for Windows Mixed Reality as a Virtual Reality SDK target. This extends Unity\'s HoloLens support so that it more generally supports Windows Mixed Reality, both for desktop and HoloLens.

-   XR: Added the TrackedPoseDriver component, which can be added to a game object to match the position and rotation of a AR device, VR HMD, or VR controller.

-   XR: Stereo Instancing (also known as single-pass instanced) is now supported on desktops when the DirectX 11 (DX11) rendering API is in use. Stereo Instancing is only supported with forward rendering.

-   XR: Unity Editor has foundation support for EditorVR. Look for a future announcement around availability of a 2017.2 compatible EditorVR version.

-   XR: Windows Mixed Reality headsets are now supported for playing in-Editor.

-   XR: Introduced native integration for the Vuforia Augmented Reality Platform. Vuforia support can be installed through the Unity Download Assistant and enabled under PlayerSettings/XR. For more information about Vuforia see<https://developer.vuforia.com>.

### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

If you have only a 5.x license, please visit https://store.unity.com/ or contact your sales representative to obtain a 2017-compatible license.

-   Graphics: When using custom shadow resolution on a light, the resolution is no longer clamped, so it can reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.

-   Licenses: Updated the FBX license to require acceptance of FBX SDK license (see[FBX SDK 2015 License and Service Agreement](https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/www/Company/docs/pdf/legal-notices-&-trademarks/Autodesk_FBX_SDK_2015_License_and_Services_Agreement.pdf))

(710503,[790887](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scenemanager-slash-gi-application-not-responding-during-scenemanager-dot-loadsceneasync),[815033](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/scene-streaming-causes-frame-rate-drop))

-   GI: Added support for LOD baking in Progressive Lightmapper.

-   GI: Added update to fill the empty areas in the lightmaps with content from the lower mip levels (push-pull dilation). This fixes visible dark pixels around geometry edges when rendering with lightmaps. The happens due to dark background texels bleeding in when lower MIPs are accessed.

    -   Fixed a crash in`       IPrecompute::PackGeometry()      `when providing an input mesh with very large UVs.
    -   Fixed a crash in`       IPrecompPackedGeometry::Load()      `when running out of memory.
    -   Fixed case of uninitialised data being serialised in`       WriteDataBlockForInPlace()      `and related functions.

-   Substance: Added support for V6 engine; Ability to use all the nodes of Substance Designer.

-   UI: Introduced a shader keyword to all of the UI shaders, which controls the rect clipping. Rect clipping now only occurs when the Mask component is enabled. This leads to much better UI performance when Masks are not used. ([784238](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-ui-performance-regression-on-motorola-moto-g))

-   Universal Windows Platform: IL2CPP scripting backend now defaults to using .NET 4.6 API compatiblity level.

-   Windows: Improved the crash dialog in the Windows Player; it now has more detail, and prompts the user to open an Explorer window for the crash report.

-   Windows: Split the player executable into two parts: a signed UnityPlayer.dll that has all the engine code, and a wrapper executable that calls into this DLL at startup. The source code for the executable is in Editor\\Data\\WindowsStandaloneSupport\\Source\\WindowsPlayer.

-   XR: Improved rendering performance of Daydream and Gear VR apps.

-   XR: Made improvements to pause handling in XR applications. Apps which need to pause when the HMD is removed no longer resume if the window focus changes, and vice-versa.

-   OSX: \[macOS\]\[High Sierra\] MonoDevelop crashes on 2nd monitor. Workarounds available:

-   XR: XR applications will throw callback unregistration asserts if the VR device is changed at runtime. These callbacks relate to analytics (for the VR device) however, so your application will experience no issues.
