-   Android: Removed fastzip support.

-   Asset Import: Reorganized the Model tab of the Model Import Settings window to improve usability.

-   Audio: Simplified the Audio Profiler so that it is consistent with other profiler panes. The detailed view enables audio profiling so that Unity only carries this out when you need it.

-   Editor: Added \'Find references in Scene\' to Component context menus.

-   Editor: Changed File menu item names. \'Save Scenes\' is now \'Save\' and \'Save Scene As\' is now \'Save As\', because they now save either a Prefab or Scenes depending on whether Prefab Mode is active. Unity still saves any dirty Assets when you use Ctrl/Cmd + S.

-   Editor: Changed Particle System module headers to only track the enabled state property instead of all properties. Also added Property menu choices to the context menu that appears when you right-click on the headers.

-   Editor: In USS files,`      flex N     `now means`      flex N 0 auto     `. It previously meant`      flex N 0 0     `.

-   Editor: When Unity builds assemblies in the Editor for the .NET 4.x scripting runtime, they now have .NET 4.6 (`      NET_4_6 define     `) set, regardless of when the .NET Standard 2.0 scripting profile is set (`      NET_STANDARD_2_0 define     `). This is because the scripting profile setting only affects players, and the Editor always uses the .NET 4.6 scripting profile.

-   GI: Renamed \'Recompile RSLS Shaders\' menu item to \"Recompile Lightmapping Shaders\".

-   Graphics: Graphics emulation is now disabled whenever a Scriptable Render Pipeline is active.

-   iOS: Marked Mono scripting backend as deprecated.

-   iOS: Unity now distributes iOS and tvOS Simulator players as dynamic libraries (dylib).

-   Particles: It is now possible to flip a percentage of mesh particles, in the same way that was previously only possible with billboards.

-   Particles: The Unlit Particle Standard Shader is now applied by default when creating new Particle Systems.

-   Windows: The Vulkan editor support on Windows and Linux is no longer experimental. Removed the \"Enable Vulkan editor support\" checkbox.

#### Improvements

-   2D: Added an option in Sprite Editor to display a Sprite\'s pivot position in pixels, and to allow the pivot to snap pixels as it is dragged.

-   2D: Added Isometric Tilemap support for 2D Tilemap.

-   2D: Added support for custom axis sorting and Sorting Groups in SRP.

-   Compute:`      ComputeBuffer.GetData     `and`      ComputeBuffer.SetData     `now throw exceptions when they get bad values for arguments. Unity checks offset and size more strictly (for one argument version, Unity assumes the offset is 0 and the size is the same as that of the container), and compatibility between C# type size and ComputeBuffer stride.

-   Docs: Expanded the documentation of the`      SerializedObject     `class.

-   Editor: Added a warning when Unity does not load assembly definition file (asmdef) assemblies on startup in cases where the assemblies do not have scripts to compile their asmdef references. Also added a warning when Unity attempts to compile asmdefs that do not have scripts in the Editor. ([1041284](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2018-shaders-hlsl-shader-is-not-included-the-first-time-project-is-opened-using-shaderincludepath))

-   GI: Added two GI profiling counters: one for pending albedo/emission renders, and one for pending Material updates.

-   GI: Lights from Particle Systems can now affect realtime GI if they have non-zero bounce intensity and Realtime GI is enabled. ([832496](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-bounce-lights-dont-affect-realtime-gi-5-dot-5-x))

![description](/sites/default/files/2018_3_improvement_particles_gi.png)

-   GI: Moved Enlighten data loading to the loading thread and added`      DynamicGI.materialUpdateTimeSlice     `to control albedo/emissive rendering per frame budget:

    -   In versions of Unity prior to 2017.2, when a Scene loads, Unity reads the Enlighten data on the main thread and renders albedo/emissive rendering in one go, causing a big spike.
    -   In 2017.2, Unity loads Enlighten data in a time-sliced manner, but still on the main thread. The main thread schedules albedo/emissive rendering with an 8ms budget per frame.
    -   From 2018.3 onwards, Unity loads Enlighten data on the loading thread. The main thread schedules albedo/emissive rendering, and you can control the budget with the`       DynamicGI.materialUpdateTimeSlice      `API.
    -   Note: Unity only reads Enlighten data on the loading thread when running in the Player. ([975975](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/enlighten-realtime-light-probes-data-fail-to-load))

-   GI: Reduced baking artifacts in areas that use interpolated normals.

-   GI: Add buttons to enable Lightprobe deringing.

![description](/sites/default/files/2018_3_feature_lightprobederinging.png)

-   GI: Unity now caches Progressive Lightmapper G-Buffers in the GI cache. Lightmap baking starts quicker if the G-Buffer is already in the cache.

-   Graphics: Added \'Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)\' option in PlayerSettings to toggle BlendShape weight range clamping and replaced the FloatField with a Slider in SkinnedMeshRenderer. ([741808](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/skinnedmeshrenderer-blendshapeweight-is-clamped-from-0-to-100))

-   Graphics: Added physical camera Gate Fit modes to Camera properties.

-   Graphics: Added support for a \"linearGrey\" texture in ShaderLab as a default Texture. It is grey 50% in linear space.

-   Graphics: Added the possibility to use ComputeBuffer in \"native\" Metal shaders (written in Metal\'s shading language).

-   Graphics: Blend shapes now use compute shaders where supported. You must enable GPU Skinning in Player Settings.

-   Graphics: Disabled robust buffer access when using Vulkan in Player builds.

-   Graphics: Implemented Asynchronous readback of GPU resources for the Metal API.

-   Graphics: Improved error messages issued when creating a texture with a specific format fail.

-   Graphics:`      Texture2DArray     `GameObjects now have an improved Editor, including the ability to preview the Textures in the Array.

-   IL2CPP: Added \"Master\" configuration to the IL2CPP compiler configuration drop-down. This configuration is optimized for speed, with complete disregard for build time. It enables compiler options that slow down compilation (for example, link time code generation on Windows-based platforms). Generated Visual Studio projects for IL2CPP scripting backend on Windows Standalone and Universal Windows Platform now also contain an optional \"MasterWithLTCG\" configuration, which you can use to enable these settings. ([1089249](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/master-builds-with-il2cpp-take-10-times-longer-than-in-2018-dot-2))

-   iOS: Added profiler blocks in native code for input events in the new input system, which enables you to see number of incoming input events.

-   Kernel: Improved archive header read performance by reducing system IO calls.

-   Kernel: The contents of ProjectVersion.txt are now updated automatically after the user accepts the \'Project Upgrade\' prompt dialog shown when opening an existing project in a newer version of Unity.

-   License: Added two parameters (\'createManualActivationFile\' and \'manualLicenseFile\') to allow you to activate your license offline via command line.

-   License: Unity now displays an error message when a Personal Edition license is blocked.

    -   Changed the behavior to keep showing updates even if \"Show Preview Packages\" is not checked while a preview package is being installed.
    -   Changed the behavior before a user chooses to show or hide Preview Packages:
    -   If a preview package is already installed, \"Show Preview Packages\" is enabled.
    -   If no preview packages are installed, \"Show Preview Packages\" is not enabled.
    -   Changed the behavior to save the user\'s choice after they have decided to show or hide Preview Packages.

-   Particles: Added \"Emit Probability\" property to Particle System Sub Emitters. This controls the chance that the sub-emitter emits particles.

-   Particles: Added \'Probability\' option to the Burst emission, to enable a random chance that a burst will or will not trigger.

-   Particles: Exposed a culling mode option that enables you to control over particle simulation whilst offscreen. ([765905](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shuriken-culled-particle-systems-cause-cpu-spikes-when-re-entering-view-after-some-time))

-   Particles: Improved Shape Module gizmos to visualize the volume emission parameter.

    -   Mesh cooking is now at least 2x faster than before

-   Playables: Improved PlayableGraph housekeeping which improves performance for large numbers of PlayableGraphs, Timelines, or Animators.

-   Prefabs: When a Prefab Asset goes missing, Unity now displays the last known overridden root Prefab instance name. It now displays \"MyGameObjectName (Missing Prefab)\" instead of \"Missing Prefab\".

-   Profiler: Added an**Options**drop-down menu to the Hierarchy toolbar in the CPU Usage view on the**Profiler**window. This change collapses samples that only occur when running the game in the**Editor**. Collapsed samples do not add the size of their managed allocations (**GC Alloc**column) to the enclosing sample. The option to collapse samples is on by default, and the samples will show up as**EditorOnly \[SomeMethodName\]**.

Also enforced the restriction of passing`      Allocator.Temp     `memory to jobs, which enables the use of`      Allocator.Temp     ``      NativeContainer     `types in Burst compiled jobs.

-   Scripting Upgrade: Added log changes made to user assemblies by the AssemblyUpdater in the file*Editor.log*. For more information, see the Logging section in[APIUpdater](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/APIUpdater.html).

-   Shaders: Generated GLSL shaders for GLSL 3.00 and higher now use medium precision instead of low precision.

-   Shaders: Shaders can now include files from packages directly, like this:`      #include "Packages/packagename/IncludeFile.cginc"     `.

-   SpeedTree: Added support for importing new SpeedTree v8 Assets (`      .st     `files) into Unity.

    -   Added support for PBR rendering.
    -   Improved vertex shader performance when computing the wind animation.
    -   Added support for top-down Billboards.

-   Terrain: Added a Mask map texture to the Terrain Layers, which is usable by custom Terrain shaders for more sophisticated shading.

-   Terrain: Added a normal scale setting, which allows you to control how far normals are disturbed from the neutral position for Terrain Layers.

-   Terrain: Added a per-pixel normal map on Terrain with instancing enabled.

-   Terrain: Made changes to allow users to specify a shader, so that shading of the basemap pass better matches the splatting passes. To do this, add the`      BaseMapGenShader     `dependency for generating the Terrain basemaps.

-   Testing: Introduced an NUnit constraint for testing whether code allocates any GC memory, along with supporting classes to integrate with NUnit\'s fluent`      Assert.That     `syntax. This allows you to write very concise tests to assert that your code doesn\'t allocate any GC memory.

-   Timeline: Added an API to rebind the PlayableOutputs to the scene.

-   Timeline: Added different colors and icons in the Timeline window when editing a PlayableDirector in prefab isolation mode.

-   Timeline: Improved performance and reduced allocations when playing a Timeline.

-   Timeline: Improved root animation in the Timeline window.

-   UI: Added Sprite Atlas Late-Binding support for UI.

-   UI: Added the ability to to use Sprite Tight Mesh inside Unity UI.

-   UI: Updated the way Unity generates bold characters when it cannot find an bold font. Unity now thickens the glyph strokes rather than horizontally distorting the glyph. ([966667](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-chinesse-bolded-arial-font-style-looks-wide-in-editor), 983200)

-   UI: Updated`      UI.InputField     `to use a cached version of`      WaitForSecondsRealtime     `to reduce GC.

-   Universal Windows Platform: Added support for building player with Visual Studio 2019.

-   Web: UnityWebRequest now supports cookies in the same game session. Added API to remove them.

-   XR: Android apps that use ARCore can now use multi-threaded rendering.

-   XR: Linear color space now works on Oculus Go and Quest. For Gear VR, driver issues might prevent linear color space from working with S7 Adreno phones on Android 7.0.

-   XR: Using presence detection on Windows Mixed Reality is now more responsive and reliable.

-   XR: XR LWRP Improvements:

    1.  Implemented single-pass double wide rendering as a stereo rendering method fallback for Android devices that do not support single-pass instancing or multi-view.
    2.  You can no longer select stereo multi-pass rendering from the Player Settings when an SRP is in use.
    3.  Unity automatically selects single-pass stereo rendering if multi-pass was previously selected before using an SRP.

#### API Changes

-   2D: Added`      Experimental.U2D.ISpriteEditor.SetPreviewTexture     `to set preview textures for SpriteEditorWindow. Importers that support`      ITextureDataProvider     `can also implement`      Experimental.U2D.ITextureDataProvider._previewTexture     `to set preview textures.

-   AI: Added new experimental`      NavMeshQuery.Raycast()     `method, which you can in jobs. It returns the list of visited NavMesh nodes.

-   AI: Added`      UnityEditor.AI.NavMeshBuilder.CollectSourcesInStage()     `, which can handle the main and prefab stages separately.

-   Android: Added Android API 28 (Pie) to the Unity scripting reference.

-   Android: Removed the public API for setting the JVM Max heap size.

-   Animation: Added an additional parameter to`      GameObjectRecorder.SaveToClip()     `for specifying the FPS of the clip generated by the GameObjectRecorder.

-   Animation: Added`      Animator.WriteDefaultValues     `that lets you force a write of the default values stored in the animator.

-   Animation: Added`      PPtr     `support for`      Animator.BindStreamProperty     `and`      Animator.BindSceneProperty     `.

-   Animation: Moved GameObjectRecorder out of experimental.

-   Animation: Refined the experimental Anim C# Jobs API. Renamed and changed some fields in AnimationStream and AnimationHumanStream. For example,`      IsValid()     `is now`      isValid     `,`      GetBodyLocalPosition()     `is now`      bodyLocalPosition     `, and`      DoF     `is now`      Dof     `.

-   Asset Import: Added the`      AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessMeshHierarchy     `callback, which allows you to modify the imported hierarchy before importing the Avatar and animation clips. ([1069175](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assetpostprocessor-doesnt-have-a-callback-to-change-the-names-of-the-imported-avatar-bones-and-animation-curves))

-   Asset Import: Added`      AssetImportContext.DependsOnSourceAsset     `to make it possible to report source dependencies during imports, in ScriptedImporters.

-   Asset Pipeline: Deprecated the overload of`      AssetDatabase.TryGetGUIDAndLocalFileIdentifier     `with the parameter`      int localID     `, because it can return a`      localID     `that has overflowed (this can happen when called on GameObjects that are part of a Prefab). Instead, use the overload that uses a long data type for the`      localID     `parameter.

-   Compute: Extended`      ComputeShader.SetTexture()     `and`      CommandBuffer.SetComputeTextureParam()     `APIs with the`      mipLevel     `parameter, which allows binding a MIP level of a read-write (unordered access) Texture to a compute shader.The`      mipLevel     `parameter is ignored unless the shader specifies a read-write (unordered access) texture.

-   Editor: Added a`      SelectRange     `API to the UIElements text field.

-   Editor: Added new fields to the ModelImporter Scripting API:

    -   `       ModelImporter.importBlendShapeNormals      `, which is similar to`       ModelImporter.importNormals      `but for blend shapes.
    -   `       ModelImporter.normalSmoothingSource      `, which controls whether to use smoothing groups or face angles to determine which edges are smooth when computing normals.

-   Editor: Added new UIElements fields:`      BoundsIntField     `,`      RectIntField     `,`      Vector2IntField     `,`      Vector3IntField     `,`      Toggle     `(refactor).

-   Editor: Added new UIElements fields:`      MaskField     `,`      LayerField     `,`      TagField     `,`      LayerMaskField     `,`      PopupField     `(refactor).

User should use`      OnValueChanged()     `.

-   Editor: Added`      EditorUtility.CopySerializedManagedFieldsOnly     `, which allows you to copy fields between any two managed objects using the Unity serializer.

-   Editor: Added`      Preset.ApplyTo(Object, string[])     `that applies the specified properties and their children to the target Object. If the array is empty it applies all properties.

-   Editor: Added`      SerializedProperty.DataEquals     `method that compares the raw data of two`      SerializedProperty     `.

-   Editor: Added`      VisualElement.SendEvent     `method to allow sending events to VisualElements.

-   Editor: Deprecated`      PlayerSettings.vulkanUseSWCommandBuffers     `. Unity now only uses SW CommandBuffers if GraphicsJobs are enabled and native Vulkan secondary command buffers are slow or have issues on some drivers. Otherwise, Unity now ignores this property.

-   Editor: Improved`      EditorGUI.EnumPopup     `and`      EditorGUI.EnumFlagsField     `:

    -   Enum options now display in the order of declaration instead of the order of value.
    -   Added support for`       [DescriptionAttribute]      `to change the display name of an enum value.
    -   Added`       includeObsolete      `parameter to allow showing obsolete enum values in the pop-up drop-down.

-   Editor: In`      UIElements     `,`      BaseControl     `is now`      BaseField     `.

-   Editor: Made changes to`      EditorGUI.EnumPopup     `:

    -   `       EditorGUI.EnumPopup      `no longer shows Obsolete values with Error flag when using`       includeObsolete = true      `.
    -   When you use`       EditorGUI.EnumPopup      `with`       includeObsolete = true      `Unity appends`       (Obsolete)      `to the name on Obsolete enum values.
    -   Added support for`       [TooltipAttribute]      `to add a tooltip on enum values when using`       EditorGUI.EnumPopup      `.

-   Editor: Marked the old Prefabs API as obsolete, because it is not compatible with the new Prefabs feature set. It still works for now, but Unity displays warnings if you use it.

-   Editor: Text fields in the Editor now use`      KeyDown     `events that receive a`      KeyCode     `and`      KeyUp     `event when the user is entering text. If you have controls that draw after a text field that need to be aware of these events, you should test for them before drawing the text field.
