-   Package Manager: Update com.unity.purchasing to 2.2.2

-   Timeline: Updated Timeline package to version 1.4.6

#### Improvements

-   Package: Update ProBuilder to 4.5.0.

-   Package: Upgrading input system package to 1.0.2

-   Scripting: Added support for Unity Version Defines in Assembly definition import options.\
    This feature improvement allows scripts to easily specify different code snippets for different unity version ranges. This is especially useful for introducing calls to newly added public APIs, in which case these API calls needs to be guarded by defines based on a unity version range of a given unity version or later.\
    Unity version range expression syntax is the same as package version range expressions. Unity version format differs from package version format, thus Unity version expressions are evaluated based on some rules specific to the Unity version format:\

    -   Comparison of release types follows the following rules: a\<b\<f=c\<p\<x. So eg. an alpha version is always smaller (earlier) than a beta version, regardless of the Incremental version.\
    -   The unity versions are allowed to have suffixes (e.g 2020.1.3-bonfire) which are ignored by the unity version comparison code\
    -   Chinese releases are equivalent to public releases (f) so for the sake of comparison in the version range expression 2020.1f3 would be equal to 2020.1c3\[\
    -   experimental releases don\'t include an Incremental Version - e.g. everything after 2020.2.1x would be treated as suffix and ignored by the version comparison.

-   Scripting: Improved code readability and naming consistency with the Unity 2021.2 and 2021.1 codebase.

-   Shaders: Shaders can now use UNITY_PLATFORM\_\<PLATFORM_NAME\> defines to specialize compilation per build target platform (examples: UNITY_PLATFORM_OSX, UNITY_PLATFORM_WINDOWS).
