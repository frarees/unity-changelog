## Release notes

### Improvements

-   Android: Apply DeviceDefault theme if available, respect user\'s theme.
-   Animation: Better formatting of the error message when animation events are fired (i.e: \"oldWrappedTime \> newWrappedTime\").
-   UI: Allow dragging anchors outside of bounds of parent when holding down Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) - the same key that disables snapping. This makes it easier to author screen transitions that support multiple resolutions, since content can be animated to move a distance that\'s a percentage of the screen width or height.
-   UI: Avoid rebatching when moving a Nested Canvas.

-   iOS/IL2CPP: Implemented Assembly.CodeBase by returning the value of AssemblyName.Name.
-   iOS/IL2CPP: Make Activator.CreateInstance work for arrays.
-   iOS/IL2CPP: Match the behavior of the Mono scripting backend by not stripping the Animation code from the engine when code stripping is enabled.
