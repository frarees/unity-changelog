-   AI: Added the`      RasterizeModifierBox     `profiler marker for the NavMesh builder step that processes ModifierBox sources.

-   Android: Added a new Android/Chrome OS player setting, \"Chrome OS Input Emulation\". If un-checked, this option disables Chrome OS\'s default behavior of converting mouse and touchpad events into touchscreen events. This allows an app to implement more complete support for these input devices. Also, fixed a bug with Android/Chrome OS touchpad scrolling.

-   Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch`      platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold     `. This specifies which CPU cores to treat as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.

-   Android: Added support for custom cursors to Android to support Player Settings and C# functions on Android version 7.0 and later.

-   Android: Allow low-level configuration of Unity threads (priority, affinity)

-   Android: If a hardware keyboard is available, Unity now uses it within UI systems, instead of always bringing up a virtual, on-screen keyboard.

-   Android: Made a large part of the Android Build Pipeline incremental which means sequential builds with zero changes are now much faster. That also means Unity no longer creates builds from scratch, but instead updates the files which dependencies have changed. If you use the IPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject callback, note that it might be operating on files which were modified by IPostGenerateGradleAndroidProject from a previous build.

-   Android: Unity gradle projects now have a new entry in gradle.properties, unityTemplateVersion. Unity increments this property whenever Unity gradle template files change. That way if you build on top of the old folder and the unityTemplateVersion is different, Unity throws an error, saying that you need to update your gradle files or build to an empty folder.

-   Android: When generating manifest files, there are new files in Library\\Bee\\artifacts\\Android\\Manifest, LibraryManifestDiag.txt, LauncherManifestDiag.txt. They contain information about why a specific permission is added to manifest.

-   Asset Bundles: Added profile marker for CRC checks.

-   Asset Import: Documented the`      MonoImporter     `class.

-   Asset Import: Improved FBX model importing speed.

-   Asset Import: Improved import performance of ASCII FBX files.

-   Asset Import: Improved import performance of FBX files.

-   Asset Import: Increased the speed of Asset Import when using mikktspace tangent generation on meshes containing degenerate triangles.

-   Asset Import: Optimized the texture import mipmap calculation when using Kaiser filtering. For example, importing 16GB of textures with mostly Kaiser mip filters is reduced from 127 seconds to 109 seconds.

-   Asset Import: Reduced peak memory usage during Model Importing.

-   Asset Import: Updated Sketchup SDK to version 2020.2.

-   Asset Pipeline: Added a new UI in the AssetImporter inspectors that display all AssetPostprocessors methods that were used in the last import of the selected asset.

-   Asset Pipeline: Added summary in the editor log about what happened during a refresh (import).

-   Asset Pipeline: Added warnings and an*Automatic Fix*button where main object names do not match the corresponding filename.

-   Asset Pipeline: Improved directory enumeration by multi-threading it.

-   Asset Pipeline: Improved project startup times. Projects with 900,000 files will load at least 30 seconds faster.

-   Asset Pipeline: Unity prefetches Asset Databases to improve Editor startup time and reduce cost of page faults.

-   Audio: Added a new*Attenuation*transition type to AudioMixer so that it can perform equal power panning for group attenuations when transitioning between snapshots.(1322673)

-   Audio: Added voice priority display in the audio pane of profiler.

-   Audio: Added VU metering information from audio mixer groups in the audio pane of profiler to make it easier to compare it against volume and audibility levels.

-   Audio: Improved the way Unity displays audio mixers inside the Audio Profiler window when the Groups and Channels and Groups view modes are enabled.\
    Previously, Unity applied the column-based sorting from the Channels view mode to the other view modes, which resulted in inconsistent sorting of channels and groups below mixers, and in mixers changing their order dynamically. This made the Audio Profiler window hard to read.\
    Unity now shows the names of the mixers in the Profiler where it previously only showed the ambiguous Master groups of the mixers below the Audio Listener group.\
    The triangle shape after the titles of the column headers in the Detailed and Clip views was changed to an arrow that more clearly indicates the sorting order. The arrow is now placed before the title instead of after it to avoid cutting the title off when you resize the columns manually.

-   Audio: Target mixer groups are now displayed in the audio profiler.

-   Bug Reporter: The Crash Handler window now includes the following UI changes:\

    -   *Stack trace*field\
    -   *Go to crash logs*button\
    -   *Report a Bug\...*button\
    -   *Open Unity Hub*button\
        Note that clicking the*Open Unity Hub*button restarts the Editor.

-   Build Pipeline: \"Scripts Only Build\" is now automatic for platforms using the new incremental build pipeline. The checkbox is removed for such platforms, and Unity will automatically detect if it can do a Scripts Only Build based on which changes there are in the project.

-   Build Pipeline: Changed Linux so that it uses the incremental player build pipeline.

-   Build Pipeline: Improved linking speed for big projects

-   Build Pipeline: Improved the performance of the build pipeline by giving concurrent shader cache folders read access.

-   Build Pipeline: MacOS Standalone player builds now use the new incremental build pipeline, which allows faster subsequent player builds by only rebuilding parts which have changed.

-   Build Pipeline: Modified Windows Standalone player builds so that they only rebuild parts that have changed since the previous build to improve build speed.

-   Build Pipeline: Removed prompt to save an untitled scene if it is not included in the build.

-   Build Pipeline: WebGL now uses the incremental Player build pipeline.

-   Burst: Automatically add \[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)\] to any delegates that are used for BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer\<;\>;() or error if the delegate has the attribute and it is not Cdecl.

-   Burst: Improved codegen.

-   Core: Modified the Dynamic Heap Allocator to reduce the time it takes to intantiate chunks in a Build.([1272168](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/slower-performance-of-instantiate-when-using-it-in-a-build-compared-to-the-editor))

-   Core: Reduced the number of memory alllocations and improved the tracking of core allocations.

-   Documentation: Added a pop-up to Obsolete API labels in the Script Reference, explaining why something is obsolete, and pointing to the new API where possible.

-   Documentation: Improved documentation for GeometryUtility.TestPlanesAABB to explain false positives.

-   DX12: \*Binded dynamic lightmaps resources (Enlighten) to ray tracing shaders:`      unity_DynamicLightmap     `,`      unity_DynamicDirectionality     `and`      unity_DynamicLightmapST     `. \*Enabled`      DYNAMICLIGHTMAP_ON     `shader keyword for when these resources are used by Renderers.
